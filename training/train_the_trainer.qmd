# What is the Train-the-Trainer program?

The Train-the-Trainer program aims to **promote open and reproducible research** across academic disciplines. Importantly, it also aims to provide researchers, project leaders or educators with in-depth pedagogical skills to confidently **train others in Open Research practices**  e.g., students, lab members, or other researchers from the same or even a different field. Therefore, the curriculum includes modules on **methodological foundations of Open Science, computational reproducibility, tools for collaborative working, data management and data sharing**. In addition, the curriculum also includes  modules on critical pedagogical skills in teaching about Open Research, such as **basic didactic skills, activation tools for learner-trainer interactions, leadership skills** as well as modules on broader issues connected to teaching Open Research such as **diversity, accessibility and cultural awareness**. 

The program therefore takes learners as well as (experienced) researchers on a journey through a wide range of Open Research practices, before diving into how to get that knowledge out into the world and into university courses, interactive workshops and one-off Open Research events. In short, the program is for those who **want to learn about Open Research**, but also those who **want to teach about Open Research**. 

## What does the Train-the-Trainer program consist of and how does it work?

Depending on your interest and level of expertise and your own goal, the program is divided into several parts. For example, if you are new to the topic, you can choose to follow the modules on Open Research. Here, the modules were designed to logically follow up one another. If you then decide that you would like to gain the pedagogical skills to teach about your brand-new knowledge, you can follow the modules on the pedagogy of Open Research. It could also be the case that you already know all about Open Research but are itching to teach about it, in which case you can choose to skip the Open Research modules and skip straight to the pedagogy modules. Of course, you can also select individual modules without following the course from start to finish.


# Who is this program for?

Should become more clear after the personas meeting 28.1.2026.

## The Open Research modules: For those who want to learn

Are you new to Open Research and currently have no idea what we are talking about? Have you heard about Open Research before and would like to develop your skills? Or are you already a pro at Open Research but need a refresher or are missing a specific Open Research practice? Then you have come to the right place!

- If you are (practically) new to Open Research, follow the curriculum here: LINK

- If you are have previous knowledge and skills in Open Research, follow the curriculum here: LINK

## The pedagogy modules: For those who want to teach

Did you just acquire knowledge and skills in Open Research and want to spread your wisdom? Have you been thinking about giving a workshop to your lab group about an Open Research topic, but are encountering resistance or little motivation? Or are you a university educator, who would like to bring the topic of Open Research closer to your learners or students? Then this content is for you!

# Partners
A key strength of the program lies in its close partnership with the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training [FORRT](http://forrt.org) community. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to systemic reform in research culture through education, grassroots collaboration, and equitable infrastructure. The FORRT project is an international and interdisciplinary community project that promotes and curates Open Science training resources and meta-research, and is committed to democratizing access to both learning and teaching materials in Open Science, ensuring equitable participation across career stages, disciplines, and geographies.

# Funding

The Train-the-Trainer program is funded by the [VolksWagen Foundation](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de).
