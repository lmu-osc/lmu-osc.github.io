title: "Educator toolkit"
---

**Welcome!** Are you an educator who (or would like to) teach open, responsible, and reproducible research practices? Or are you looking to share your Open Research knowledge and skills with your group but not sure how to effectively communicate these concepts?

If you answered yes to either question, then our **educator toolkit** is for you!

## What is the educator toolkit?

Our educator toolkit follows a 'train-the-trainer' model, where we provide training materials and support for educators to build on their Open Research knowledge and pedagogy skills to deliver high quality and engaging Open Research content for their learners. The broader goal of the toolkit is to promote **open and reproducible research** across academic disciplines. 

## What does the educator toolkit offer?

In this toolkit, you can find: 

- **Pedagogy materials and practical tips** including **critical didactic skills, didactics, activation methods for learners, leadership in open research and accessibility** on how to successfully convey and deliver classes and workshops on Open Research topics to different audiences.

## Frequently asked questions

1. **Do I need prior experience in Open Science to use the toolkit?**

- No. The materials are structured to support educators at different levels of prior knowledge. Foundational concepts are introduced clearly, and additional resources are provided for more advanced engagement.
  

2. **Are the pedagogical materials discipline-specific?**

- No. The core pedagogical principles apply to all academic disciplines. The materials on pedagogy and didactics are therefore designed to be interdisciplinary and adaptable across academic disciplines, e.g., (social) sciences, humanities etc. We also used examples from different fields.
