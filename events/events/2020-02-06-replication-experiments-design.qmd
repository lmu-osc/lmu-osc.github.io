<p>Statistical power is of central importance in assessing the reliability of science. Appropriate design of a replication study is key to tackling the replication crisis as many such studies are currently severely under-powered. The workshop will describe standard and more advanced methods to calculate the required sample size of a replication study taking into account the results of an original discovery study. Participants will learn how to use the R-package ReplicationSuccess. Prerequisites include basic R-knowledge and familiarity with concepts of statistical inference.</p><p> </p><p>Trainer:</p><p>Leonhard Held is Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Zurich and Director of the Center for Reproducible Science. Charlotte Micheloud and Samuel Pawel are PhD students developing new methodology for the design and analysis of replication experiments.</p><div class="g-clear"></div>
