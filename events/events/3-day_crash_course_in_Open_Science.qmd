description: 'Good scientific practice in empirical disciplines nowadays goes beyond
  the avoidance of bad practices, such as plagiarism or data fabrication: science
  is expected to be reproducible, funders and journals increasingly demand open data
  as a precondition for funding and publication, and the need for preregistration
  of studies expands beyond the medical sciences.'
