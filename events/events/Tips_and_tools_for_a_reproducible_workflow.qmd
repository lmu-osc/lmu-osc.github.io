description: The LMU Open Science Initiative in Psychology (OSIP) cordially invites
  to the online workshop "Tips and tools for a reproducible workflow?" led and organized
  by Dr. Caroline Hygar-Hoffmann and Moritz Fischer. In a mix of input and hand-on
  sessions you can learn more about how to design your workflow in research projects
  in a way that you as well as everyone who will be involved with your projects (e.g.
  project members, reviewers, or your research community) will be able to reproduce
  it later and you will work more efficiently.
