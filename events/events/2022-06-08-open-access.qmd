<p>The Open Science Initiative Psychology (OSIP), in collaboration with the LMU Open Science Center, offers a practice-oriented workshop for scientists at all career levels on the topic of "Open Access" (speakers: Prof. Dr. Felix Schönbrodt and Maximilian Frank). We explain the different types of Open Access and and their advantages and show what different ways there are to make your own publications freely accessible. We also go into the business models of scientific publishers and take a critical look at their increasing activities as data analysis companies.</p><p>The event will take place in German or in English depending on the composition of the audience.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class="g-clear"></div>
