<p>Following last week's successful meeting, we are excited to invite you to the upcoming session of our journal club. The session will stand under the topic of Open Access, and with the session based on the paper „The academic, economic and societal impacts of Open Access: an evidence-based review“ by Tennant et al<em>.</em>, we will take a look at the benefits and implications of Open Access publishing in academia.</p><p><strong>Procedure: </strong>A member of the organising team, Alp Kaan Aksu, will summarise the paper by Tennant et al. There will then be an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.</p><p><strong>About the journal club: </strong><a href="../../meetups/reproducibilitea/index.html" title="ReproducibiliTea Journal Club">Here</a> you can find further information about the concept of the journal club.</p><p>You are cordially invited to attend our upcoming meetings!
