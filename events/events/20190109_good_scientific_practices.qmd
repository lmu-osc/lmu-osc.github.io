<p>The OSC offers a workshop for graduate students, PostDocs and faculty members on <a href="https://gsparmed.wixsite.com/website">"Good Scientific Practices and how to Avoid Research Misconduct" (GSP|ARM!d)</a> led by <strong>Dr. Michael Mende</strong> from the International Max Planck Research School for Translational Psychiatry (IMPRS-TP).</p><p>The workshop aims to bring participants up to date with the standard statutes of research integrity as well as local regulations at place. The course is structured around the <strong>DFG Curriculum</strong> „Good Scientific Practice“ for Courses in Science and Medicine (G. Sponholz | 10/2011), with particular emphasis on the following topics: <strong>Data</strong> storage, handling and protection,<strong> Documentation</strong>, <strong>Publication</strong> process and <strong>Authorship</strong>, <strong>Plagiarism </strong>and <strong>Conflict Resolution</strong>. During the workshop, participants will be engaged in discussions, group work, role play and case studies. All participants will receive relevant material: a tool-kit with institutional guidelines, local contact points, links to useful web resources as well as relevant publications, which they can refer to throughout their scientific careers.</p><p>For further information take a look at the <a href="https://gsparmed.wixsite.com/website">GSP|ARM!d Website</a> or contact <a href="mailto:felix.schoenbrodt@psy.lum.de">Felix Schönbrodt</a>.
