<p>Are you working within RStudio to wrangle and analyses your data?</p><p>Join this 3 hours workshop to learn how to track and manage changes in your code so you never have to save multiple copies of your script again (e.g. before deleting a piece of code or trying a new function, or just for back-up!). Version control with Git and GitHub will make your workflow cleaner and more reproducible and allow you to code (or even write manuscripts) collaboratively.</p><p>This workshop will focus on how to use Git and Github within the RStudio IDE and consists in facilitated self-paced tutorials: <a href="https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub">https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub">https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub</a> that include the setting up and configuring of all software required.</p><p><strong>Participants</strong>: The targeted audience are novices regarding version control / Git, but who use RStudio at least occasionally. No R knowledge is necessary.</p><p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Participants must have their own laptop with admin access. Software will be installed as part of the workshop. No previous knowledge necessary.</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong>: Pat Callahan (Epidemiology), Felix Henninger (Statistics), Alp Aksu (Psychology), and Dr. Malika Ihle (LMU Open Science Center coordinator)</p><p>The event will be held in English. </p><div class="g-clear"></div>
