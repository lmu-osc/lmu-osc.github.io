<p>The Journal Club: “ReproducibiliTea” at LMU Munich continues after a break with its 14th meeting, the first one for this semester. It will take place next Friday and consist of an introductory session to Open Science. Its purpose is to introduce new people to Open Science and our journal club, but also give an overview about the topic for those who are already familiar with it.</p><p><strong>Paper:</strong> This time we did not select any specific paper. So just join and enjoy the session :-)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Two members of our organising team will give an introductory talk on Open Science and the replication crisis (approx. 30 minutes). We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.</p><p>Below, you can find a short abstract for the session and its introductory presentation by two members of your organisation team, Gracia Prüm and Laura Goetz (LMU Munich).</p><h3><span style="color: #404040; font-family: verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">Welcome to the Open Science Universe</span></h3><p>You have never heard of Open Science before? In our presentation "Welcome to the Open Science Universe" we are going to give an introduction to Open Science as well as the most important terms and topics linked to it. Have you ever wondered what goes wrong in science and why, and what you can do about it? Then you have come to the right place! Just a little spoiler: the goal of Open Science is to make science reproducible, open and accessible for everybody. Of course, we are also happy if people join us who are already experts in the field of Open Science, which will only make the discussion more interesting.</p><h2>Concept of the Journal Club</h2><p>The interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.</p><p>The Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.</p><p>During a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.</p><p>You are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to <a class="g-link-mail" href="mailto:reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com" title="Send email to: reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com">reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com</a> to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.</p><p>The organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.</p><p>Organisation team:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;">
