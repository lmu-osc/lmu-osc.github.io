# A header here {#sec-header1}

This is a section with a header. We can refer to it using `@sec-header1`. For example, @sec-header1 has the custom `sec-prefix` applied or we can remove the prefix entirely with -@sec-first-h2.

Or we can refer to the link with a custom text: [this section](#sec-header1)

Potential option to show both number and name `-@sec-first-h2 \nameref{sec-first-h2}`: @full:sec-first-h2 \nameref{sec-first-h2}

^Note: the LaTeX crossref syntax is not supported in Quarto, so `\nameref{sec-first-h2}` will not work in the LaTeX output.



make use of lua filter:
 
See @fullsec(sec-first-h2) for details.
