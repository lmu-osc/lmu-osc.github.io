<h2>Becoming OSC Institutional Member</h2>
<p class="intro-text">In practice, institutional members contribute as little as a statement of commitment to work towards the OSC goals - they then become Affiliated Institutional Members. Institutional Members are also encouraged to provide yearly funds to the OSC (depending on the size of the institution) - they then become Funding Institutional Members.</p>
