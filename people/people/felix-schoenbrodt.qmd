# Mission statement paragraphs - variable number
mission_statement:
  - I am principal investigator for Psychological Methods and Assessment at the Department of Psychology, the managing director of the LMU Open Science Center, and steering group member of the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/psy/de/forschung/meta-rep/">META-REP priority program</a> ('A meta-scientific research program to analyse and optimise replicability in the behavioral, social, and cognitive Sciences').
  - The reproducibility of research findings is a core criterion of science, which however, has been challenged by the failure of recent large-scale replication projects. To foster open science practices, I teamed up with colleagues and established our department's "Open Science Committee" in 2015. The outcomes of this committee include an open science paragraph which we included in all recent <a href="https://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-practices/">professorship job descriptions</a>, adding transparency criteria to the department's <a href="https://www.nicebread.de/distribute-funding-based-on-research-transparency/">performance-based funding system</a>, or introducing <a href="https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/studium/lehrelounge/kerncurriculum_empra/index.html">modules on preregistrations, open data, and reproducible scripts</a> as mandatory components in undergraduate courses.
  - Together with the board of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) I developed the society's <a href="https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Empfehlungen/Datenmanagement_deu_9.11.16.pdf">recommendations for data sharing in psychology</a> [<a href="https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Empfehlungen/Data_Management_eng_9.11.16.pdf">English version</a>]. In 2016, I received the <a href="https://www.bitss.org/people/felix-schonbrodt/">Leamer-Rosenthal-Prize for Open Social Science</a> from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (<a href="https://www.bitss.org">BITSS</a>).
  - In the DFG-funded META-REP project "<a href="https://www.lmu.de/psy/de/forschung/meta-rep/projects_2fp/">From 'Academic works' to 'Working in academia'</a>" we are analyzing reform proposals for academia in an agent-based modelling approach.

<!-- The "includes" below are templates for the different sections of the
member profile pages. Each document returns an R object that contains the
necessary HTML elements to render the section.
 1. You can modify these templates to change the layout or content of each section. This will change the layout of all member profiles the next time the site is built.
 2. You can also create new templates for additional sections if needed.
 3. If you want to add some custom content for an individual member, you can do so directly in the member's .QMD file, outside of the includes. You will then need to insert the new R object containing HTML into the `profile` object below.
