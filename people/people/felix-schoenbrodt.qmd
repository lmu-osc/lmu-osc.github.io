mission_statement: |
  I am principal investigator for Psychological Methods and Assessment at the Department of Psychology, the managing director of the LMU Open Science Center, and steering group member of the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/psy/de/forschung/meta-rep/">META-REP priority program</a> ('A meta-scientific research program to analyse and optimise replicability in the behavioral, social, and cognitive Sciences').

  The reproducibility of research findings is a core criterion of science, which however, has been challenged by the failure of recent large-scale replication projects. To foster open science practices, I teamed up with colleagues and established our department's "Open Science Committee" in 2015. The outcomes of this committee include an open science paragraph which we included in all recent <a href="https://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-practices/">professorship job descriptions</a>, adding transparency criteria to the department's <a href="https://www.nicebread.de/distribute-funding-based-on-research-transparency/">performance-based funding system</a>, or introducing <a href="https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/studium/lehrelounge/kerncurriculum_empra/index.html">modules on preregistrations, open data, and reproducible scripts</a> as mandatory components in undergraduate courses.

  Together with the board of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) I developed the society's <a href="https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Empfehlungen/Datenmanagement_deu_9.11.16.pdf">recommendations for data sharing in psychology</a> [<a href="https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Empfehlungen/Data_Management_eng_9.11.16.pdf">English version</a>]. In 2016, I received the <a href="https://www.bitss.org/people/felix-schonbrodt/">Leamer-Rosenthal-Prize for Open Social Science</a> from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (<a href="https://www.bitss.org">BITSS</a>).

  In the DFG-funded META-REP project "<a href="https://www.lmu.de/psy/de/forschung/meta-rep/projects_2fp/">From 'Academic works' to 'Working in academia'</a>" we are analyzing reform proposals for academia in an agent-based modelling approach.
