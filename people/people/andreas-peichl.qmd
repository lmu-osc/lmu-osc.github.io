mission_statement: |
  - I am Professor of Macroeconomics and Public Finance at the Department of Economics, Director of the ifo Center for Macroeconomics and Surveys and in the Board of Directors of the LMU-ifo Economics &amp; Business Data Center (EBDC). 
  - Replicability of empirical studies is a must for “good scientific practice”. The EBDC is offering such opportunities (<a href="https://www.ifo.de/en/reseach/lmu-ifo-economics-business-data-center">https://www.ifo.de/en/reseach/lmu-ifo-economics-business-data-center</a>) and I hope that many researchers will make use of the opportunities that we offer.
