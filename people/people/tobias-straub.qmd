  - Nowadays, first priority in my work as a scientist is to implement and teach reproducibility measures in basic life science. Looking back to 20 years of wet lab research I realized that I hardly ever designed an experiment properly. This is a common problem that will not be solved by top-down measures but by systematic education of new generations of scientists.<strong> </strong>
