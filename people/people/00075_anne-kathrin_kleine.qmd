mission_statement:
  - <em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Mission Statement: </strong></em>
  - I embrace the values of openness and transparency in science. I believe that such research practices increase the informational value and impact of our research, as the data can be reanalyzed and synthesized in future studies. Furthermore, they increase the credibility of the results, as an independent verification and replication is possible.<br>For this reason, I signed the <a href="http://www.researchtransparency.org">Commitment to Research Transparency</a> and the <a href="https://www.opennessinitiative.org">Peer Reviewersâ€™ Openness Initiative</a>.
