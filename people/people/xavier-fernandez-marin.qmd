mission_statement: |
  I am lecturer at the Geschwister-Scholl-Institut (GSI) for Political Science at the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität).

  For a free society to thrieve we need an open discussion of ideas. Our responsibility as a scienists is to do our part and be fully open with our procedures, tools and methods. Personally, I am commited to make it easy for others to replicate what I do, as it is the only way to review the procedures, to spot inconsistencies, and to provide new ideas to make science advance.
