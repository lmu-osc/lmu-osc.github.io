mission_statement:
  - <em><strong>Mission Statement</strong></em>
  - I am research group leader and Professor for Experimental Neurology at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research.
  - Research must always be performed in an open and reproducible fashion. This is especially true in the age of big data, which can facilitate questionable research practices, such as p-hacking. Sharing methodology, pre-specifying analyses and independent replication are the best tools to solve the reproducibility crisis. I’m looking forward to working with the Open Science center in order to promote Open Science.
