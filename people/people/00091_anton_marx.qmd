  - I am professor for Biometrics and Bioinformatics at the Institute of medical informatics, biometry and epidemiology.
  - We support data sharing and Open Science in the sense of the FAIR statement (<a href="https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/">https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/</a>): Data should be findable (unique and persistent identifier, description of metadata), accessible (retrievable in open formats with appropriate license and access conditions), interoperable (ready to be combined with other datasets), and reusable (offering documentation needed to understand the data and analysis).
