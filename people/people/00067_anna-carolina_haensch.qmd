mission_statement:
  - I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair for Statistics and Data Science in Social Sciences and the Humanities (SODA) at the Department of Statistics. I am mostly working on questions related to survey methodology and missing data.
  - I am very interested in open source software development and open data in statistics and sociology. I teach introductory and advanced statistical methods as well as statistical methods to sociology students and try to include topics on Open Science. In my own research, I try my best to publish reproducible analysis code and make available or use open data.
