mission_statement: |
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology.

  Open Science is crucial for statisticians as it promotes transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility in research, ultimately enhancing the quality and impact of statistical analysis. Our field faces a delicate balance between respecting legitimate data protection interests on one hand and the ethical imperative to maximize the utilization of valuable research data on the other. I believe the Open Science Center provides the ideal framework to address these challenges.
