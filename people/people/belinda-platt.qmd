mission_statement: |
  I am currently a temporary ("Vertretungs") Professor of Developmental and Child and Adolescent Clinical Psychology at the University of Kiel. Since 2013 I have been a post-doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/kinder-und-jugendpsychiatrie/klinik-kompakt/unser-team/2e8bb7baefad4e9c">Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the LMU Klinikum</a>, where I maintain my research group. Since conducting my PhD I have been passionate about improving transparency in Psychology research. In 2017 I signed the <a href="https://www.researchtransparency.org">Commitment to Research Transparency statement</a>. Since 2021 I have been a member of the<a href="../../../../meetups/osim/index.html" title="LMU Open Science Initiative in Medicine"> Open Science in Medicine (OSIM)</a>. I try to upload principles of Open Science in my research group.
