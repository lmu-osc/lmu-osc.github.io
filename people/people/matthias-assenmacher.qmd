mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Statistical Learning and Data Science (Dept. of Statistics, LMU) and the NFDI Consortium for Business, Economic and Related Data (BERD@NFDI). 
  - In my role as a lecturer, I try to convey the principles and values of open science and open data to the students. As a researcher in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, I stick to the open science principles by publishing data and code as well as by making my research papers open access. Being part of BERD@NFDI also means fostering open science culture, with a special focus on enabling other researchers to share their data and algorithms more easily.
