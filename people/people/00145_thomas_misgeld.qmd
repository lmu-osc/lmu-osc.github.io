mission_statement:
  - I think the scientific publishing process is in a process of transformation – and ensuring the principles of open science are equitably implemented in the system that emerges is very important. To be able to engage with like-minded groups of scientists in a discussion of how the publishing models of the future should look like, is one of the key motivations for me to join the OSC.
