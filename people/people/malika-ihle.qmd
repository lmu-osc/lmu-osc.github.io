mission_statement: |
  I am the Coordinator of the LMU Open Science Center, developing a comprehensive approach to open research that extends across all disciplines at LMU Munich, using both bottom-up and top-down strategies.

  My role is to provide peer-to-peer training and develop an open research curriculum, coordinate grassroots initiatives and organise various events, support meta-research collaborations, liaise with local, national, and international stakeholders to inform the design of incentives and policies, and co-develop a strategic plan to make the OSC a key sustainable entity benefiting LMU Munich.
  
  I am the German Reproducibility Network ([GRN](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de/)) local network lead.
  
  Prior to this, I was in a similar role for 2.5 years at the University of Oxford, coordinating Reproducible Research Oxford ([RROx](https://ox.ukrn.org/)) and acting as the UK Reproducibility Network ([UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org/)) local network lead.
  
  I hold a PhD in Biology, and I am a founding member of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology ([SORTEE](https://www.sortee.org/)).

<!-- The "includes" below are templates for the different sections of the
member profile pages. Each document returns an R object that contains the
necessary HTML elements to render the section.
 1. You can modify these templates to change the layout or content of each section. This will change the layout of all member profiles the next time the site is built.
 2. You can also create new templates for additional sections if needed.
 3. If you want to add some custom content for an individual member, you can do so directly in the member's .QMD file, outside of the includes. You will then need to insert the new R object containing HTML into the `profile` object below.
