mission_statement: |
  Opening up Science does also include the closer integration of the wider public in the process, be it via citizen science or democratizing access to results. Furthering these goals has been a huge part of my interest in crowdsourcing, Wikimedia projects and FAIR data (WikiFAIR), aside from the fact that these endeavors are fun in itself.
