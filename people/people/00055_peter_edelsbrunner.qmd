  - <em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - As an educational psychologist with a background in quantitative methods, I got in contact with the emerging open science movement around 2010, when the triplet of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Bem#%22Feeling_the_Future%22_controversy" target="_blank">Bem-controversy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Stapel#Scientific_misconduct" target="_blank">Stapel-case</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False#:~:text=%22%20Why%20Most%20Published%20Research%20Findings%20Are%20False,is%20considered%20foundational%20to%20the%20field%20of%20metascience." target="_blank">Ioannidis-paper</a> got it all started. I enjoy doing open science, thinking about meta-science, and being part of a slow yet daring process towards improvement.
  - In the spirit of the great thinker and educator John Dewey, I live and teach open science as a process of continuous growth rather than a fixed skill set, defending the position that socially constructed justification is more important than rigid rules and norms. Practices I use most are open data and materials, and I prefer unblinded and transparent reviewing.
  - I edited journal issues on <a href="https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1015-5759/a000743" target="_blank">registered reports in understudied populations</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1091721/full" target="_blank">daring methodologies in Psychology</a>, and have been part of many <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt2jd8c5x8/qt2jd8c5x8_noSplash_11decbeb65d6456e90034854b4f23bd3.pdf" target="_blank">analysts</a>- <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2022.2070255" target="_blank">endeavors</a>.
  - For me, open science practices are demanding and require continuous effort and improvement, so I highly appreciate anyone's engagement.
