mission_statement:
  - I am head of the Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence. In our research we aim for ensuring reliability of AI-based methods through a profound mathematical understanding and providing possibilites to explain the results. Recently, we detected theoretically that digital hardware causes serious limitations for AI, leading to research in the direction of software-solutions for analog hardware such as neuromorphic computing and quantum computing. Finally, we apply artificial intelligence in a trustworthy manner to problems from medical imaging, robotics, and telecommunication.
  - Research in the area of artificial Intelligence requires extensive amounts of data. From my viewpoint, reproducibility of experiments is not sufficiently considered at present. Hence I am a strong supporter of incorporating more open science practices into AI research.
