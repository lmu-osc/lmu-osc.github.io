mission_statement:
  - I am professor emeritus for Theoretical Linguistics and German Linguistics. 
  - In the first years of this century the extremely clever experimental design of Lera Boroditsky’s studies managed to undermine my deep skepticism about Neo-Whorfianism, so I encouraged my students to have a closer look. After several failed replications my skepticism regrew. Similarly with other early cases of experimental linguistics: a PhD dissertation I supervised dared to challenge a publication in the prestigious journal Language and got as much as five replication failures. Since then I am a strong supporter of OS (my recent study on new words includes a self-replication). I signed the Peer Reviewers’ Openness Initiative, and I encourage every student to observe Open Science practices.
