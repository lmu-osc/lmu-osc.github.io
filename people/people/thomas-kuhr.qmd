mission_statement:
  - I am leading the Experimental Flavor Physics Group that is studying the fundamental laws of physics with data from the <a href="https://www.belle2.de/">Belle II experiment</a> in Japan.<br>As the effort of collecting large amounts of particle collision data is very high, it is important to optimally exploit the recorded data. I am convinced that this is best achieved by Open Science. This requires that the FAIR principles are not only applied to data, but also the to the whole infrastructure required for the analysis of the data, including in particular the software. I have led a task force to established an Open Source Software Policy at the international Belle II collaboration and taken care of the <a href="https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/papers/11534/files/877-PublicBelle2Software.pdf">publication of its main software</a>. I am also working on technologies that facilitate the reuse and reinterpretation of data.
