mission_statement:
  - I am a Principal Investigator and Professor at the Biomedical Center (BMC; LMU Munich). <a href="https://www.renkawitz-lab.com">My research lab</a> is interested in understanding the cellular principles, molecular mechanisms and mechanobiology of the immune system. I am convinced that research transparency, research reproducibility, and research data sharing is critical for the gain of knowledge in science. As my research frequently involves live-cell microscopy, I am further interested in the development of good scientific practices in data storage and data sharing of large imaging datasets.
