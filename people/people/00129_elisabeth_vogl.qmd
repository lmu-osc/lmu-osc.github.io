mission_statement:
  - <br>I am postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Personality and Educational Psychology at the Department of Psychology.
  - My passion is to understand emotional processes and how they interact with motivation and cognition particularly in educational contexts. In my opinion, the Open Science Movement is a great reminder for the scientific community that only together we can create reliable knowledge. Therefore, I am committed to implement openness and transparency in my own research, and to encourage it in my reviews, as well as in cooperation with colleagues and students.
