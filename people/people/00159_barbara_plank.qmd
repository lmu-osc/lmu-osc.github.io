mission_statement:
  - <em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - Sharing is caring! Open science is essential to drive progress, support transparency, reliability, reproducability and replicability of science. My research field is Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Computational Linguistics (CL). In NLP/CL, I strongly believe that sharing resources publicly (data, code, publications) has led to not only foster an inclusive research community, but has also contributed to lifting the field from a small research area into a central field in AI research, where the main goal is to develop inclusive language technology.
