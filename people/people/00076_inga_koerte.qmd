  - <em><strong>Mission Statement</strong></em>
  - Leading and coordinating large collaborations, I learned the value of good documentation and reproducible ways of working. I aim for my lab to develop a step by step open research practice guide tailored to our research so we can onboard new members directly into an efficient and transparent workflow.
