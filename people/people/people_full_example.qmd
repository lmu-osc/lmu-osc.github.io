mission_statement: |
  I am the Coordinator of the LMU Open Science Center, developing a comprehensive approach to open research that extends across all disciplines at LMU Munich, using both bottom-up and top-down strategies.

  My role is to provide peer-to-peer training and develop an open research curriculum, coordinate grassroots initiatives and organise various events, support meta-research collaborations, liaise with local, national, and international stakeholders to inform the design of incentives and policies, and co-develop a strategic plan to make the OSC a key sustainable entity benefiting LMU Munich.
  
  I am the German Reproducibility Network ([GRN](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de/)) local network lead.
  
  Prior to this, I was in a similar role for 2.5 years at the University of Oxford, coordinating Reproducible Research Oxford ([RROx](https://ox.ukrn.org/)) and acting as the UK Reproducibility Network ([UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org/)) local network lead.
  
  I hold a PhD in Biology, and I am a founding member of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology ([SORTEE](https://www.sortee.org/)).
