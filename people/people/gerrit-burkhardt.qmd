mission_statement: |
  I am a clinician-scientist specializing in the development of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions for the treatment of mental health disorders. In my field, there are still many reservations and prejudices against open science practices. To address this, I am committed to establishing FAIR data principles and promoting transparent research practices within my working group and collaborations.
