mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Psychology of Excellence in Buisness and Education at the Department of Psychology.
  - My area of research is educational psychology and my passion is to understand basic psychological principles through exploring their relevance in the applied field of teaching and learning. I consider the Open Science movement a wonderful opportunity to focus again on the key prerequisites of high-quality scientific inquiry : In-depth theorizing, rigorous hypothesizing, precise operationalizing, stringent analyzing, and -- only then -- wrapping our heads around what the results may mean.
