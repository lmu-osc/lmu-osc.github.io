mission_statement:
  - I am a PhD student at the Department Psychology, Psychological Methods and Assessment. I believe research outputs produced at public universities are part of the commons and we should decidedly oppose any enclosures. In my work I am interested in science from a meta perspective, looking at the role of repeating activities, the impact of mistakes and the effectiveness of reform initiatives. Where possible I only work with free/libre software.
