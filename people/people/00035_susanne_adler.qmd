  - <em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Marketing at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich with a research focus on consumer decision-making and meta-science. Accessibility and transparency play a key role in advancing our understanding of human behavior. Specifically, we as researchers should make the best out of the research outputs (e.g., materials, data, code) that we have by effectively sharing, preserving, and reusing such outputs. This is why, in my own work, I aim to share materials, data, and code in a comprehensible way and make research processes transparent.
