mission_statement:
  - I am heading the <a href="https://www.compbio.bmc.med.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html" title="About Us">Bioinformatics Core Facility at the Biomedical Center</a>, LMU.
  - Nowadays, first priority in my work as a scientist is to implement and teach reproducibility measures in basic life science. Looking back to 20 years of wet lab research I realized that I hardly ever designed an experiment properly. This is a common problem that will not be solved by top-down measures but by systematic education of new generations of scientists.<strong> </strong>
