mission_statement: |
  I’m a professor of marketing at the LMU Munich School of Management. While my main research interest is in the advancement of research methods to further the understanding of consumer behavior, I have gained interest in transferring principles of metrology—measurement science in the physical sciences—into the social sciences in an effort to improve replicability.
