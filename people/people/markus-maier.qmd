mission_statement: |
  I am professor for General Psychology (Emotion and Motivation) at the Department of Psychology.

  Good scientific research practices require large sample studies as well as confirmatory studies. As such, the chair of General Psychology II established a lab that aims to help researchers to effectively and quickly run their studies under controlled conditions.
