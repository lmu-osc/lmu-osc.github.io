mission_statement: |
  I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Modeling in Psychology unit at the department of psychology.

  To me, openness and transparency are core values of scientific practice. I try to implement them in my own work by following Open Science practices, and I try to communicate them to students and colleagues in lectures and workshops. As a researcher in psychological methods, I also contribute to methodological reform by finding adequate approaches for planning studies and analyzing data. During my PhD in the Netherlands, I co-founded the Amsterdam section of the ReproducibiliTea journal club, and I enjoy good-faith discussions about what constitutes good scientific practice. As a current co-chair of the Open Science Initiative in Psychology (OSIP), my goal is to foster open and participatory scholarship at an institutional level.
