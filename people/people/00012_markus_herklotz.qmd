mission_statement:
  - Through our Consortiu for Business, Economics and Related Data in the National Research Data Infrastructure (BERD@NFDI), we promote the (re-)usability and sharing of (unstructured) data. The focus of my work is to organize training and educational toolboxes in our <a href="https://www.berd-nfdi.de/berd-academy">BERD Academy</a> for researchers to make use of these data, learning the necessary data science methods and data management practices. In BERD@NFDI, we also offer services to make your life with research data easier: For example our<a href="https://www.berd-nfdi.de/servicestools/legal-questions-in-data-science/"> interactive Virtual Assistan</a>t (iVA) which guides you through the GDPR.<br>In my research as a sociologist, I am interested in the description &amp; assessment of competences in data science as well the implementation &amp; evaluation of different (e-)learning formats exploring various data sources.
