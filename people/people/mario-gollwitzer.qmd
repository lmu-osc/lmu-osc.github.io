mission_statement:
  - I am professor of Social Psychology at the Department of Psychology. The recent discussions about the replicability of psychological effects gave me some pause. I hope (and somehow believe) that "open science" has the potential to increase replicability rates and to raise the quality of psychological research. As member of the executive board of the <a href="https://www.dgps.de" target="_blank">German Psychological Society</a>, I have contributed to the development and implementation of recommendations regarding data sharing in the scientific community. In my own lab, I encourage the use of open science practices and a full commitment to openness and transparency in our research projects.
