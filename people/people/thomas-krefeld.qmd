mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Romance Linguistics.
  - The framework for science communication has radically changed during my generation. But this has not only produced the complex questions of research data management; at the same time, strict ethical maxims have arisen which are very well expressed by the FAIR principles: Our data must be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Reasonable rules for transparency and openness in research is to the benefit of the community of researchers and an obvious indicator of its vitality. Those who reject this social contract accept the disappearance of numerous, not least small, disciplines traditionally labelled with the (very German) name of 'Geisteswissenschaften'.
