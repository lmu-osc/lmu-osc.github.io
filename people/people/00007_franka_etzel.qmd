mission_statement:
  - I´m a psychology student at the LMU and the topic of Open Science has stuck with me ever since I heard about it for the first time in our statistics course. Especially through my job as a student assistant at the Chair of Psychological Methods and Diagnostics I learned more about Open Science and good scientific practice not only in theory. It started becoming more and more important to me so that I recently joined the organisational team of the Journal Club "ReproducibiliTea". To me it´s very important to further deepen my knowledge about Open Science and good scientific practices so I can spread the ideas and discuss different aspects of Open Science with others.
