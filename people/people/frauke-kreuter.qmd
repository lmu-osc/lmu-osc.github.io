mission_statement: |
  My work spans statistics, data science, and survey methodology, and I view open science as an essential foundation for credible and impactful empirical research. Through my involvement in the Center, I aim to help strengthen institutional support for open research workflows, contribute to collaborative initiatives that foster responsible data use, and promote a culture of openness within the broader scientific community.
