mission_statement: |
  I am currently a research scholar at the UC San Diego Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, USA, and a research assistant at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE), LMU, Germany. I practice anesthesiology at the Medical Center of the University of Munich (LMU Klinikum), with additional experience in critical care. In December 2018, I joined the working group Anesthesia &amp; Critical Care Informatics and Data Analysis Group (ACID).

  My research interests are in perioperative medicine and developing predictive models for critically ill patients. In addition to exploring machine learning methods to personalize blood transfusion triggers, I am excited about being a team member of building an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) data warehouse to establish a cross-institutional distributed ledger.

  In my current project, Reliable Response Data Discovery for COVID-19 Clinical Consults using Patient Observations, many health institutions answer COVID-19 questions by consulting, in a privacy-protecting manner, data from electronic health records. We share concept definitions, query codes, and results to allow reproducibility. 'Open Science' can be the key for impactful research.
