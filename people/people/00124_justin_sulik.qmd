mission_statement:
  - I study the psychology of science. This includes investigating the cognitive traits and social contexts of scientists as they collaborate to solve complex problems. I also explore the traits and contexts of laypeople as they try to understand our modern world, especially cases where people distrust science or reject scientific consensus on topics such as climate change or vaccine safety. My main engagement with Open Science is in the sharing and development of best practice for assessing and improving data quality in online questionnaires and experiments. In order to make transparent decisions about how (or whether) to filter poor-quality responses, and to evaluate how these decisions might impact conclusions, we need open survey materials, transparent reporting of data-quality indexes, reproducible data-processing scripts and detailed quality-assessment scripts.
