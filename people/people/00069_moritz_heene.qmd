mission_statement:
  - I am a professor for Learning Sciences Research Methodologies at the Department of Psychology.
  - We make reproducible analysis code available for every publication, see our „Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science“ (<a href="http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/">http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/</a>). Starting 1 January 2017, I will not offer comprehensive review for, nor recommend the publication of, any manuscript that does not meet the minimum requirements of the „Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative“ (<a href="https://opennessinitiative.org/signatories/">https://opennessinitiative.org/signatories/</a>). As acting director of the Doctoral Training Program of the Munich Center (DTP), I also work on incorporating research transparency into the DTP.
