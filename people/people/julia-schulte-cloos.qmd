mission_statement: |
  I am LMU Research Fellow at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science and an advocate of open science. I have been actively involved in teaching reproducible research. I am convinced that spreading knowledge about research transparency tools and practices helps to promote support for open science among students and the scientific community.

  I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.bitss.org/catalysts/">catalyst network of the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)</a>.
