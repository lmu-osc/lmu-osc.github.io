mission_statement:
  - I’m currently studying Medicine and Psychology. During my Psychology studies back in 2018, I first heard about Open Science. Since then, I’ve tried to conduct Open Science methods in my work (especially preregistration, open data and materials) and encourage my fellow students to engage with Open Science. That’s why two of my colleagues and I founded a journal club back in 2019, in which we discuss papers and topics around Open Science. I am convinced that the Open Science movement will be most successful if we talk about it, discuss it, inform about it and support local initiatives.
