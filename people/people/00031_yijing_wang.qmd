mission_statement:
  - I am currently a PhD student at LMU, focusing on the etiology and treatments of Alzheimer's disease. Early in my research, I encountered some challenges with scientific data management, which led me to the field of Open Science. After participating in several LMU OSC workshops, I have gained a deep understanding of best practices in research, such as experimental design and data management. I am eager to contribute to the Open Science community by teaching other researchers how to utilize tools like Git and the Open Science Framework. These tools are essential for enhancing transparency, sharing data and analysis, and ultimately fostering a more collaborative and reproducible scientific environment.
