mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Statistics at LMU and the Department of Computer Science at Boston University.
  - Open science is at the heart of any scientific endeavor, as the goal of science should be to be transparent and inclusive without too high entry barriers. I lead by example in teaching reproducible quantitative research and contributing open-source software to the research community.
  - In my research, I focus on balancing the seemingly contradictory goals of open science/open data and privacy protection, for example, through synthetic data with formal privacy guarantees.
