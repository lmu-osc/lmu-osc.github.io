mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoc working in the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research at the LMU University Hospital. My research focuses on the involvement of the microbiota in modulating stroke severity and outcome. Working in this relatively new field, I have noticed many datasets or code are not publicly available and those that are, often exclude critical metadata or other information necessary to reproduce findings. I believe in my field and others this hampers translational research and thus aim to actively encourage open science practices. In this context I am particularly passionate about data/code sharing and the use and development of software which facilitates open science.
