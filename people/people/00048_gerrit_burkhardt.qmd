  - <em><strong>Mission Statement</strong></em>
  - I am professor for Psychological Methods and Assessment at the Department of Psychology.
  - Research transparency is a core value of my working group. In my term as managing director of the Department Psychology, I supported the foundation of the department's Open Science Committee (<a href="https://osf.io/mgwk8/">https://osf.io/mgwk8/</a>) in July 2015. Furthermore, many members of my working group signed the „Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science“ (<a href="http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/">http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/</a>).
