mission_statement:
  - I am a Research Associate and Doctoral Candidate at the Department of Statistics, and part of the Chair of Applied Statistics in Social Sciences, Economics and Business. I am also an active member of the COVID-19 Data Analysis Group (CODAG) at the LMU.
  - I believe that making science more transparent and open to the public is of paramount importance to maintain its credibility and increase its weight in public decision making. For this reason, I think science should invest more in effective communication. I am also an advocate for more data literacy within the general population, which I think will be needed to effectively challenge present and future societal challenges.
