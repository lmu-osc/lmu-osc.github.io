mission_statement:
  - I am an archaeologist asking anthropological questions about the human past. I think archaeology is uniquely positioned at the intersection of science and humanities, and in some ways, enables us to unite the capabilities of both spheres of scientific inquiry. The process by which we collect and process data and thereby produce a narrative of the past parallels the way the past is revealed to us by the creators of the objects and their narratives. Thus, how we apply open science in todayâ€™s world not only has a direct bearing on data integrity and transparency, but also shapes the development of equitable narratives in science and society at large (where we combat rampant misinformation and confirmation biases). There is considerable distance between the way Open Science reforms are being expedited in the natural and social sciences today and how humanities are leveraging these practices to gain fresh perspectives that authentically showcase the human experience. I am interested in how we close that gap.
