mission_statement: |
  Being a researcher who works on funds coming from public money, I feel the responsibility to provide reproducible and transparent research knowledge that is accessible to the public.

  The mainstream publication processes are driven by neoliberal market logics, and besides can be inefficient, lengthy, and not assuring quality papers. With a great part of my research participants being based in South and Southeastasian regions, open accessibility of my research outcomes is imperative to me. However, open access publishing in high-ranked journals is costly and contradicts my understanding of research dissemination.

  I support the open science movement because I find it a great way to counter the mainstream practices of academic knowledge production and sharing.
