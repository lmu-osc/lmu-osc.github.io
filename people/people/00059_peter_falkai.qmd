  - <em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Mission Statement: </strong></em>
  - I am the Deputy Medical Director of the University Hospital Munich. Performing basic scientific and clinical studies in the field of schizophrenia research for the last 30 years, I am very interested in replicable findings and an openness for the community to work with our data. We have just been able to publish our first paper open-science and hope many more to come.
