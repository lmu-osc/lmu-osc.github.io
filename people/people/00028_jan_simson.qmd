mission_statement:
  - I am currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics at the Social Data Science and AI Lab (SODA). As someone originally coming from the field of Psychology, I observed the importance of open science and reproducible research first hand. I am now working on applying these learnings to other fields such as machine learning in my research and spreading the necessary competencies by teaching courses on open science and research software engineering.
