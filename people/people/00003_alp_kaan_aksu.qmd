mission_statement:
  - I am currently studying psychology at the LMU and computer science at TUM. Even before I started studying psychology, I had a lot of questions related to good scientific practice, and few weeks into my first psychology semester at the LMU, I learned about the Open Science movement (thanks to the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club!). I think it is very valuable to learn more about Open Science, to talk about it with others, to come up with new questions and to try to find answers together. This is why I joined the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club. I am now part of the organisation team of this Journal Club as I think it is one of the best places to start raising awareness about Open Science and spreading good scientific practice among students, since mostly bachelor's and master's students attend our meetings. On a related note, I am also interested in science communication and how we can make scientific knowledge accesible to everyone.
