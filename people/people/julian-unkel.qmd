mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Media and Communication. My field has been slowly but steadily adapting open science practices in the last few years. I try to promote open science by consequently following open science standards in my own research, by contributing to open-source research software development, and by integrating topics such as preregistration and reproducibility into my course syllabi. I am also part of an international multi-author team that suggests “An agenda for open science in Communication” in the Journal of Communication.
