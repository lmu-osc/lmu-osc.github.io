mission_statement: |
  I am a psychologist and licensed psychotherapist (CBT) for children and adolescents at the department of psychology at the University of Munich (LMU). In my research as well as my teaching activities, I embrace the values of openness and transparency in science. That is why I signed the „Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science“ and strive to conduct open, transparent, reproducible, and credible research.
