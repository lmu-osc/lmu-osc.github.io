  - <em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - <em><strong></strong></em>Quoting the statistician Andrew Gelman: „We are all sinners!“. He uses this to describe how we all have made mistakes in statistics. In Open Science is exactly the same. The question is what do we do about it. Do we live further in sin or we try for redemption? I am trying to get out of the cycle taught to me. Open Science is unusual but challenging at the same time. We get to see what we should keep and what we should change from the old science way. For what I have seen, the change is difficult but the tools are there. We just need to learn them and make them public and accessible for the community. That is what I am trying to do every day with my students, my colleagues and all who want to listen. All what I am learning I am making it public in YouTube, so that others have an easier transition. My area of research is infection biology. We really need Open Science and FAIR data principles to understand the real relationship of microorganism with humans and environment.
