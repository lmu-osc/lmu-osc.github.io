mission_statement:
  - <em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology.
  - Research methodology and metascience more generally have been my academic passion for over 15 years. I am convinced that science needs to be as open as possible and sensible in each case, in order to be of most value for science and society, now and in the future.
  - For this reason, I aim to integrate as much scientific openness as reasonable in my own research and when supervising student projects. As a visiting and guest professor, I introduced teaching materials on open science in the compulsory lectures for psychology students. Now I am working on the determination of replication success.
