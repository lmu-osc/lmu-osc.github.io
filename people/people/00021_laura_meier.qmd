mission_statement:
  - I am part of the RDM information team at the LMU University Library and studying computer science at TUM. Open science practices are essential for improving research and should have a higher profile as part of the study programme. Within my work at the library, I teach skills for good data management, focusing mainly on data management plans. Furthermore, our team offers services, tools and infrastructure to enhance Open Science practices and supports researchers and students in all topics related to research data management.
