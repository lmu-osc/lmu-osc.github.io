mission_statement:
  - <em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></em>
  - My research aims at clarifying how key aspects of social behaviours in animals, such as their genetic architecture and phenotypic plasticity, alter the potential for sociality to evolve. I am working towards using Open Science practices more systematically in my own research, e.g. providing pre-registered reports, usable datasets and analysis code. I am also interested in communicating about Open Science ideas and improving research practices in my field.
