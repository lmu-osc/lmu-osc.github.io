mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Social Psychology group at LMU Munich. Reproducibility and transparency are of vital importance to me, both theoretically and practically. Theoretically, part of my research is dedicated to identifying and examining the factors influencing the replicability of social psychological research. Practically, in my own research, I am committed to maintaining a high level of transparency by openly sharing materials, research data, and published manuscripts whenever possible, through Open Access options or pre-prints. Additionally, I consider sample size planning and preregistration to be essential standards for replicable research, which I have consistently applied to my own work and advocated for as a reviewer for academic journals and in supervising student theses.
