Thanks to third party funding (e.g. Volkswagen Foundation) and LMU funding (e.g. LMU central study grant) our team comprises the following employees. The OSC is supported by several student assistants who maintain our website, help with the logistics of our events, post on our social media accounts, or contribute in the development of training material. If you are interested in becoming a HiWi for the OSC, please contact Dr Malika Ihle (malika.ihle@lmu.de).
