                    Founded in June 2021, the LMU Open Science Initiative in Statistic (OSIS) at the Department of Statistics supports the goals of the OSC and wants to take on a leading role in fostering good research practices and promoting open science. The department believes that statistics as a subject plays a major role in solving the reproducibility crisis and in working towards better, open research.

                    The Department of Statistics is involved in the development and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Statistical consulting and teaching are at the core of the department's activities.
