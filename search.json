I think archaeology is uniquely positioned at the intersection of science and humanities, and in some ways, enables us to unite the capabilities of both spheres of scientific inquiry. The process by which we collect and process data and thereby produce a narrative of the past parallels the way the past is revealed to us by the creators of the objects and their narratives. Thus, how we apply open science in today’s world not only has a direct bearing on data integrity and transparency, but also shapes the development of equitable narratives in science and society at large (where we combat rampant misinformation and confirmation biases). There is considerable distance between the way Open Science reforms are being expedited in the natural and social sciences today and how humanities are leveraging these practices to gain fresh perspectives that authentically showcase the human experience. I am interested in how we close that gap."

Even before I started studying psychology, I had a lot of questions related to good scientific practice, and few weeks into my first psychology semester at the LMU, I learned about the Open Science movement (thanks to the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club!). I think it is very valuable to learn more about Open Science, to talk about it with others, to come up with new questions and to try to find answers together. This is why I joined the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club. I am now part of the organisation team of this Journal Club as I think it is one of the best places to start raising awareness about Open Science and spreading good scientific practice among students, since mostly bachelor's and master's students attend our meetings. On a related note, I am also interested in science communication and how we can make scientific knowledge accesible to everyone."

The organisation team is happy to  welcome Aaron Peikert (Max-Planck-Institute Berlin) as our guest who will give the introductory presentation and participate in the open discussion afterwards.\n\n\nThe meeting is dedicated to the topic “The Ideal of Preregistration and what warrants it”. Aaron Peikert has recently uploaded a draft for a paper on “Why does preregistration increase the persuasiveness of evidence? A Bayesian rationalization”. During our meeting, he will present some of his ideas from this draft and take up further debates around the issue of preregistration. Below you will find a short abstract that provides more information on the topic of the presentation.\n\n\nWe prepared the following key questions to guide you through the discussion and also provide some guidance while reading the paper. The presentation will take up some of the ideas from the paper, but present them in a more “discussion-friendly” way and go beyond the topic. For each question, you can think about the suggestions from the paper, but also bring in your own ideas:\n\n\n\nWhat are objections to preregistration?\n\n\nTo what extent can incomplete preregistrations (e.g. only regarding study variables, but without an exact analysis plan) be useful?\n\n\nWhat is the actual purpose of preregistration?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Aaron Peikert below:\n\n\nThe Ideal of Preregistration and what warrants it \n\n\nThe replication crisis spurned many researchers to preregister their analyses before acquiring data. However, there is no agreement on what preregistration should accomplish and why it is uniquely suited to these goals. A widespread view is that preregistration should limit how much the data may influence the hypotheses tested on the same data (i.e., restrict researchers’ degrees of freedom)). If no such influence occurs, an analysis is generally considered confirmatory. Consequently, many researchers believe that only confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.\n\n\nIn this presentation, Aaron Peikert argues that limiting preregistration to confirmatory research is unnecessarily restrictive. To that end, he will suggest how to formalize the objective of preregistration and aim to demonstrate that exploratory studies also benefit from the practice. Lastly, implications for the practice of preregistration will be discussed.\n\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\n\nAaron Peikert is a PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin and has been an Open Science enthusiast since his bachelor’s degree. His work focuses on preregistration, reproducible workflows, structural equation models and machine learning approaches for nested/ hierarchical data.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nAlp Kaan Aksu, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFinia Loeb, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

Many factors have been suggested as contributors to irreproducible biomedical research, including poor study design, analytic instability of measurement methods, sloppy data handling, inappropriate and misleading statistical analysis methods, improper reporting or interpretation of results, and on rare occasions, outright scientific misconduct. Potential for these problems to occur is amplified when the research involves use of novel measurement technologies such as “omics assays” which generate large volumes of data requiring specialized expertise and computational approaches for proper management, analysis and interpretation [http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx]. Successful translation of omics research findings to safe and effective clinical tests requires a research team with expertise including laboratory and clinical science, bioinformatics, computational science, and statistics. Team members share responsibility for ensuring that research is performed with integrity and best practices are followed to ensure reproducible results. Although making data and computer code publicly available are valuable and important first steps toward promoting reproducible research, they are not sufficient. Through a series of case studies, the many dimensions of reproducible omics research are explored, and shared responsibilities are discussed. Maintaining a culture of reproducible research requires effort, resources, and vigilance to counter many potential threats.\n\n\n \n\n\nFollowing Lisa McShane’s talk, two further talks and a subsequent discussion will be held on the STRATOS-Initiative:\n\n\n\nWilli Sauerbrei, 6:00-6:20 pm: The STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies (STRATOS) initiative – aims, concept and the general approach\n\n\nJörg Rahnenführer, 6:20-6:40 pm: STRATOS Topic Group 9: Analysis of high-dimensional data: Opportunities, challenges and goals\n\n\nDiscussion: 6:40-7:00 pm"

In a nutshell, Quarto lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of executable code written in, e.g., R or Python. You can use it for interactive notebooks, and export to a large number of formats including HTML, PDF/LaTeX, Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or even interactive websites. In this workshop, we cover the fundamentals, including the markdown syntax, code chunks and inline code, and the output formats available. We also go over citations, cross-referencing, and templating, which ultimately allow you to write academic papers entirely in Quarto.\n\n\nThe self-paced tutorial for this workshop can be found here: https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-Quarto/\n\n\nThe self-paced tutorials focus on using Quarto with R and RStudio, which is also used by the instructors in their research and teaching. They are, however, no experts for every possible environment, but will try their best to assist you.\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are total novices or intermediate users of literate programming tools (e.g. Rmarkdown, Quarto), who program (at any level) in R, Python, or Julia, and preferentially use RStudio (although VS Code, Jupyter, Neovim or other text editor are also suitable). Ideally, participants already know of or use version control.\n\n\nRequirement: Participants must have their own laptop with admin access. Software will be installed as part of the workshop.\n\n\nInstructor: Dr Florian Pargent and Florian Kohrt\n\n\nThe event will be held in English."

One way to deal with this methodological flexibility are sensitivity analyses. In this short workshop, we will discuss when sensitivity analyses can be useful, what they can look like in practice, and how they can be embedded in scientific publications.\n\n\nRegistered Reports (http://cos.io/rr) are a publication process now adopted by over 300 journals in psychological science and beyond, in which Stage 1 journal peer review occurs on a pre-registration plan prior to any data collection. Once the pre¬registration passes peer review and is approved, the journal grants authors an in-principle acceptance guaranteeing the publication of the article provided that data collection and analysis follows and intended plan. This emphasizes design, methods, and rigor, addressing issues of reviewers’ and publication bias with publication of findings regardless of data collection outcomes, with the Stage 2 peer review focused solely on ensuring adherence to the Stage 1 plan (or documenting deviations).\n\n\n‎“Peer Community in Registered Report”‎ (PCI-RR; https://rr.peercommunityin.org/) is a new initiative launched in 2021 that builds on Registered Reports and is aimed at improving further on Registered Reports. It provides community open identified peer-review on posted Registered Report Stage 1 preprints, led by open-science trained recommenders (editors), with in-principle acceptance from the community endorsed for publication by a variety of open-science supportive journals. This initiative also includes an option for a “scheduled review” path which allows timely community expert open-science supportive peer review within two weeks, short enough to fit into an academic year thesis schedule. PCIRR is nothing short of a revolution in science.\n\n\nWith guided thesis students and an early-career researcher team building on work by undergraduate students in my courses, in the last two years we submitted over 20 PCIRR manuscripts, with some already published, and most already granted an in-principle acceptance. Overall, it has been a very positive and rewarding experience for the students and the team. This is part of a large-scale replications project of over 100 classic studies in judgment and decision-making and social psychology. Information on this project and how to join us can be found on: https://mgto.org/core-team/\n\n\nIn this workshop I will share my experience with Registered Reports, PCIRR, and working on Registered Reports with students and early-career researchers. I will go over relevant templates and guides from our many open collaborative resources (https://mgto.org/resources/), going over best practices and examples of Registered Reports. Finally, and most importantly, we’ll aim to write a simple Replication Registered Report together, hands-on, to demonstrate the process – step by step.\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are scientists of all career levels (from MSc) from any confirmatory quantitative research\n\n\nRequirement: Participants should bring their own laptop.\n\n\nInstructor: Dr. Gilad Feldman (Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong)\n\n\nThe event will be held in English."

Multiple defensible alternative options are available for selection throughout the study design, data preprocessing and data analysis workflow. In line with a traditional analysis approach, researchers will select one sole workflow of defensible options and often do not specifically disclose how the decisions were made. However, a multiple comparison problem occurs even if only one constructed dataset following one single workflow of decisions is used for statistical inferences. The reason is that theoretically a large variety of workflows is possible, but researchers do not correct their hypothesis tests for potential comparisons that they did not explicitly carry out.\n\n\nRecently, statistical approaches have been proposed to explore and integrate multiple inferential results accumulated along forking paths. Multiverse analysis (Steegen et al., 2016) refers to repeated hypothesis testing on the multitude of datasets resulting from different defensible decisions regarding, for example, variable selection, categorization, transformation, outlier selection, etc. After combining all potential choices by simple rules of combinatorics, contradictory combinations are eliminated. Datasets created on the basis of the remaining set of combinations are then submitted to statistical analyses along a looped pipeline. Results provide as many outcomes of statistical tests as datasets created in the multiverse. These can then be visualized to understand how statistical conclusions depend on methodological decisions or they can be statistically integrated.\n\n\nIn this workshop, unexperienced attendees who attended the lecture on the previous day will be guided through an implementation example of multiverse analyses on the R Software for Statistical Computing. There will be time for exercises and discussions. Workshop materials and necessary R packages will be shared in advance and participants are expected to join the workshop with their own laptops.\n\n\nInstructor: Andrea Hildebrandt, Professor for Psychological Methods and Statistics at the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Department of Psychology and Cassie Short, Postdoc at the Psychological Methods and Statistics Lab of the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Department of Psychology\n\n\nParticipants: Scientists from any discipline who apply statistical models in the framework of regression analysis, without prior experience with multiverse analysis implementations.\n\n\nPrerequisite: Basic statistics (including GLM) and statistical programming skills in R are required. R software must be installed prior to the workshop. Participants must also have attended the lecture on the previous day: https://www.pretix.osc.lmu.de/lmu-osc/multiverse-L/\n\n\nLogistics: The event will be held in person, in English. Participation in the workshop is free and open to all. Priority will be given to, in order, members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (Department of Psychology, Business Administration, Biology), other LMU members, and non-LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

We will then continue with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nThe session including the open discussion afterwards will focus on general and concrete ideas on how to promote Open Science at a local level. Instead of recommending a paper as the basis for our discussion, we would simply ask you to think about some ideas to the following key questions:\n\n\n\nWhat are the most effective measures to enforce open science practices in your field?\n\n\nWhat role do local Open Science initiatives (e.g. journal clubs) play in promoting Open Science?\n\n\nWhat opportunities do you personally have to promote Open Science, and which might be most promising?\n\n\n\nBelow, you can find a short abstract for the introductory presentation by Dr. Malika Ihle (LMU Open Science Center):\n\n\nGetting active – How can we foster Open Science within our university?\n\n\nThe Open Science movement was very successful in recent years and has found more and more supporters. However, there is still a lot to be done to achieve the desired goal of transparent research process becoming the norm in science. But what would be the next steps and the most efficient measures to accelerate this cultural change towards Open Science? And how can each individual contribute to achieving this goal?\n\n\nIn this presentation, Dr. Malika Ihle will introduce a framework for fostering Open Science within the scientific community. She will discuss the different roles of bottom-up and top-down actions in the cultural change towards openness and transparency in science. Finally, she will talk about some specific ideas on how Open Science can be promoted at local level and what steps each individual could start with to growth their community.\n\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\n\nDr. Malika Ihle is the Scientific Coordinator of the LMU Open Science Center and supports its scientific board to promote and foster Open Research across all disciplines within the LMU and beyond. Before she joined the LMU, she worked for 2.5 years in a similar position at the University of Oxford where she coordinated Reproducible Research Oxford (RROx). Malika is an Open Science enthusiast and expert, always looking for new ideas to advance the Open Science movement. Her experience ranges from providing Open Science training to coordinating grassroots-initiatives and co-developing strategic plans for universities to roll out Open Science practices across faculties and departments. She holds an PhD in Biology and is a founding member of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE).\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

The organisation team is happy to announce that the paper’s authors, Dr. Tobias Wingen and Marlene Altenmüller, will give an introductory talk to this session and participate in the open discussion afterwards:\n\n\nParticipants can use the following key questions to prepare for the discussion:\n\n\n\nHow could researchers restore public trust in social sciences (damaged by the replication crisis)?\n\n\nHow should researchers inform a) the public and b) their students about the replication crisis in social sciences?\n\n\nWhat role do self-criticism and doubt play in communicating one’s research a) to the public and b) to students?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talks by Dr. Tobias Wingen and Marlene Altenmüller below:\n\n\nPublic Trust in Science and the Replication Crisis: Challenges and Opportunities for Science Communication\n\n\nThe replication crisis and scientific self-correction are central topics in the current psychological debate. However, less is known about how non-scientists (e.g., the public) react to these controversies.\n\n\nIn the first part of this talk, Tobias Wingen will present a series of studies showing that low replicability may damage public trust in psychological science. These studies further show that this damaged trust is difficult to repair. Overall, this line of work suggests that non-scientists react negatively to failed replications.\n\n\nIn the second part of the talk, Marlene Altenmüller will present studies that demonstrate no harm of researchers’ self-correction (i.e., self-criticism of prior research and intentions for reforms in future research) on the public’s trust in science. This line of work suggests, that non-scientists favour a critical stance towards science. The presenters look forward to a stimulating discussion, which may focus on similarities and differences of their approaches, implications for science communication and teaching, and future direction.\n\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\n\nMarlene Altenmüller\n\n\nMarlene Altenmüller is a research associate with the social psychology group at LMU Munich. Her work focuses on trust in and within science and, more broadly, science reception (e.g., motivated science reception), as well as art reception (e.g., aesthetic experience and impact) and social justice (e.g., justice sensitivity). Marlene’s doctoral thesis – hot off the press – applies social psychological theories on trust, stereotypes, and self-disclosing communication in the domain of researchers’ science communication and laypeople’s trust in science.\n\n\nDr. Tobias Wingen\n\n\nThe work of Dr. Tobias Wingen focuses on trust in science and science communication, which he often studies from a social-cognitive perspective. A central topic of his work are determinants and consequences of trust in science. For example, his research showed that scientific quality control (such as peer-review or successful replication studies) fosters public trust in science. His work further demonstrated that trust in science, in turn, is a central predictor of various beneficial behaviours, such as protective behaviour during pandemics. Tobias recently completed his doctoral degree at the Social Cognition Center Cologne (University of Cologne) and is now a postdoctoral researcher in the Research Group on Health and Risk Communication at the Institute of General Practice and Family Medicine (University Hospital Bonn).\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons.

Miriam Solomon has therefore aptly characterized medicine in terms of a developing, untidy, methodological pluralism. But can philosophers help with this development? In recent years, philosophers of science have become increasingly interested in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods employed in medicine. Some have defended the methodological superiority of randomized controlled trials, or at least meta-analyses of such trials. Others have challenged this superiority by on the one hand stressing the weaknesses of such methods in terms of their internal or external validity, and on the other hand emphasising the strengths of alternative methods, including methods involving expert judgement and mechanistic evidence.\n\n\nThe online conference will bring together philosophers of science and medical methodologists in an attempt to make progress towards resolving these debates concerning the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods employed in medicine. Among others, the following topics will be covered within the conference:\n\n\n\nFoundational issues in statistics in medicine\n\n\nBias in medical inference\n\n\nMedical epistemology\n\n\nMulti-agent medical epistemology\n\n\nMechanisms in medicine\n\n\nAnalogy and extrapolation in medicine\n\n\nExpert judgement in medicine\n\n\n\nThe conference is organized by Dr. Jürgen Landes, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy and member of the LMU Open Science Center (OSC), and Dr. Michael Wild, Admissions Officer for the Department of Philosophy at the University of Kent.\n\n\nMore information about the schedule, all speakers and the presented topics can be found at the website of the conference.\n\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please send an email to juergen.landes@lrz.uni-muenchen.de with the following subject line: “Registration: Philosophy and Methodology of Medicine”. A registration covers all three days. Registered participants are not required to attend all talks."

In our new panel discussion series, we try to make this tacit knowledge open by asking the relevant questions to a diverse set of experts.\n\n\nPRACTICES AND PRACTICALITIES OF PEER REVIEWMost researchers spend a significant amount of time and effort on peer reviewing. However, there is large variability in peer reviewing practices and little guidance for early career researchers on the topic. For this panel discussion, we assemble experts from different fields of psychology to talk about their experiences with peer review from a reviewer’s and/or editor’s perspective. We talk about how they developed their own style of peer reviewing, what they consider a good peer review, tips and tricks for peer-reviewing efficiently, and how their personal scientific philosophy influences their peer reviews.\n\n\nPanel Members: \n\n\n\nDr. Marlene Altenmüller (Social Psychology)\n\n\nDr. Peter Edelsbrunner (Learning Sciences, ETH Zürich)\n\n\nDr. Nathan Evans (Computational Modeling in Psychology)\n\n\nDr. Florian Pargent (Psychological Methods and Assessment)\n\n\nProf. Dr. Tobias Staudigl (Cognitive Neuropsychology)\n\n\nDr. Charlotte Wittekind (Clinical Psychology)\n\n\n\nTarget audience: Anyone curious about how other people write peer reviews\n\n\nPrerequisites: None (no peer reviewing experience required)\n\n\nMax. number of participants: No maximum"

Participants deepened their knowledge in more specific topics such as pre-registration or the implementation of data protection guidelines when publishing data sets. However, the focus of the event was on training participants in how to disseminate Open Science and related topics to other students. In addition to input lectures, there were many practical exercises about, for example, dealing with counterarguments or conducting one’s own workshops. The aim of the workshop was to help participants to implement their own ideas in order to disseminate Open Science at their universities throughout Germany, especially among students. In addition, we the workshop offered an opportunity for exchange among students who are interested in improving research. The workshop was led by Angelika Stefan (University of Amsterdam) and Felix Schönbrodt (LMU Munich) with organizational support by Leonhard Schramm (LMU Munich, Psychology council)."

It will already take place this Friday and its purpose is to share, discuss and develop ideas about what the broad term and concept of open science is actually about and how it is intervened with other issues and concepts (e.g., research integrity, transparency, rigour of methods). For this session, it would be particularly helpful if people with different perspectives (e.g. disciplines, career stages) participated in order to get as diverse a picture of Open Science as possible.\n\n\nPaper: There is no specific paper that you should read for this session. Just bring in your own thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nProcedure:  Members of our organising team will give a short introduction at the beginning to introduce the topic and structure of this session. Then we will continue with group work in smaller groups. Finally, there will be enough time to collect all the ideas from the small groups and discuss them among all participants.\n\n\nBelow, you can find a short abstract for the session.\n\n\nElaborating the umbrella term: What is your idea of Open Science?\n\n\nThe umbrella term “Open Science” covers a wide range of different efforts that presumably have some central aspects in common. But what are these central aspects that are shared by all or most Open Science enthusiasts or researchers in general? And what other issues and concepts might be described as intertwined with or closely related to Open Science (e.g., research integrity, rigour of methods, inclusiveness, incentive structure)? In this session, we would like participants to share their different ideas and thoughts on what Open Science actually is, e.g. what its core values are, or on the other hand, what issues might still represent controversies within the Open Science movement. The aim is also to explore where one’s own idea of Open Science is perhaps too narrow and where it could perhaps even be expanded. We hope that the contributions from different perspectives (e.g. scientific disciplines, qualitative/quantitative research) will help to broaden and sharpen the view of Open Science.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Prüm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

More generally, open research refers to efforts to ensure that the research process is transparent, with equitable access for all to learn, understand, contextualise, build upon, or even assess or verify the research.\n\n\nIn the last few years, many novel approaches, tools, and technologies have emerged that allow for a comprehensive representation of the research process that goes far beyond descriptions of research methods and results as found in traditional scientific articles. Open research practices have the potential to revolutionise the way research outputs are communicated, and to facilitate research collaborations in an unprecedented manner. However, adopting these practices requires knowledge and skills that are not usually taught in undergraduate or graduate degree programmes.\n\n\nTo start closing this gap, the LMU Open Science Center, supported by the LMU Faculty of Biology, and with guest instructors from the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology, offer a three days crash school to guide early career researchers (MSc. students, PhD students, and postdocs) towards an open, transparent, and reproducible research workflow.\n\n\n Programme\n\n\nThe three days crash course will consist of a series of lectures and workshops on the following topics:\n\n\n\nReplicability crisis & Open Science Framework\n\n\nReproducible workflows & Version control\n\n\nPreregistration & Simulation of data\n\n\nBiases & Common statistical mistakes\n\n\nData sharing & Meta-analysis \n\n\n\nSee schedule as a pdf in the download section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication processLMU members from any scientific discipline can apply.Members of the Faculty of Biology, which is sponsoring this event, will be given up to 30 seats, and 10 seats will be reserved for any other LMU members or researchers in the Munich area.\n\n\n\nApplicants will be asked to provide a brief statement (max. 300 words) about their motivation and future or recently started research projects in which they would like to apply open and reproducible research practices. When relevant, the statement should address what particular challenges applicants encountered in their work which would be addressed by the crash course; what open research practices they already practice; if any other courses were attended; etc.\n\n\nIf more applications are received than can be accommodated, the organising committee will select participants on the basis of the project and experience that they describe. We will favor applicants who are novices but who have already identified a need for applying the skills acquired.\n\n\nFollowing acceptance, we require a signed form from the supervisor/PI to indicate that they will support the use of transparent and reproducible practices in the applicant’s research project.\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPlease contact the LMU Open Science Center Coordinator, Dr Malika Ihle: malika.ihle@lmu.de with any questions."

The talk takes the field of psychology as a starting point, but also makes more general points about statistical practices, NHST, and academic incentive structures that apply to many scientific fields.\n\n\nAfter the talk, the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club team will be hosting an open discussion with the presenter from 16:00 to 17:00. Participants will be able to ask follow-up questions to the lecturer and discuss own ideas in a less formal and more open round. There will be no additional presentation on the topic, so it would be best to attend the lecture before (see above).\n\n\nBoth the lecture and the discussion will take place solely in person on this occasion.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIt is plausible that the widespread use of Questionable (or worse) Research Practices has substantially contributed to the current replication crisis in psychology. But would we still have a replication crisis if everyone had always played by the rules?We like to believe that we are aiming to be objective and self-critical, working towards a reliable body of knowledge about the mind/brain. Our methodological Superego is still guided by Popperian Falsificationism and Feynmanian “bending over backwards”. However, our methodological Id wants to publish as many influential papers as we can, with as few resources as possible. In this Freudian model, it is the job of the methodological Ego to negotiate between these two conflicting desires.Our current system of methodological conventions, rules, and practices, essentially a fusion of inverse Falsificationism and NHST, is very effective at keeping both Superego and Id happy: it gives the impression of being objective, self-critical, and scientific, while at the same time making it very easy, too easy, to reach evidence standards that allow us to publish our claims. This means that even if we all “played by the rules”, we would still not produce reliable knowledge.It is very difficult to change this situation, because the current incentive structures in scientific psychology strongly reward the publication of attractive findings, while there are hardly (if any) negative consequences for publishing false claims. Nevertheless, I will optimistically suggest a number of potential improvements."

This will make your own workflow more reproducible and allow you to code (or even write manuscripts) collaboratively.\n\n\nThe workshop consists in facilitated self-paced tutorials: https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub and https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub which include the setting up and configuring of all software required.\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are complete novices regarding version control / Git, but who use RStudio at least occasionally. No R knowledge is necessary.\n\n\nRequirement: Participants must bring their own laptop with admin access and have an internet connection. Software will be installed as part of the workshop. No previous knowledge necessary.\n\n\nParticipation in the workshop is free and open to all LMU affiliated researchers. However, priority will be given to members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (e.g. Department of Psychology). Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop.\n\n\nThe event will be held in English."

The organisation team is happy to announce that one of the paper’s authors, Daniel Leising, will give an introductory talk to this session and participate in the open discussion afterwards:\n\n\nParticipants can use the following key questions to prepare for the discussion:\n\n\n\nWhich aspects should be part of a high-quality scientific article in general, regarding empirical research as well as any kind of review?\n\n\nWhich are the main problems in the current incentive structures in science and how can they be addressed most effectively? You can think about the suggestions from the paper, but also bring in your own ideas.\n\n\nWhich types of consensus building do already exist (in your discipline) and do they meet the requirements suggested in the paper? You can think about the different aspects mentioned in the paper (e. g. common terminology, research questions), but also about how the consensus is built (e. g. special types of reviews, position papers by expert groups).\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Daniel Leising (TU Dresden) below:\n\n\nDoing good research should not be bad for your career\n\n\nMany of the now well-documented problems with research integrity are rooted in the current incentive structure in academia: We earn rewards by publishing a lot, getting cited a lot, and acquiring lots of grant money. All of this is possible, however, without contributing much to scientific knowledge. The question of whether we actually help solve important intellectual or even practical problems is at risk of becoming irrelevant. Moreover, the current system is easily gamed by those whose motives are not primarily scientific in nature. Being diligent in your research may easily mean the end of your career. Given that most of our work is tax-funded, and tax-payers rightfully expect some credible return on their investment, I argue that we need a radical overhaul of our incentive system: Scientists need to be explicitly rewarded for doing good work, not just lots of work.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproJucibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the name “ReproducibiliTea”. The slogan of the Journal-Club at LMU Munich is “ReproJuicebiliTea” matching the covered topics (Reproducibility & Open Science) and the extended selection of drinks. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, the first meetings after relaunching the event series will be hold online until it is possible to do them on site. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nAs before, the Journal Club will consist of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and will be explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session will start with a short talk about the paper and then continue with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team intends to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that will be discussed in each session. From now on, the author herself/himself will start with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there will be enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

The first event aims to raise awareness and discuss the relevance of reproducible and robust research, why a strong network of initiatives working towards open research in Germany is needed, and what this network’s role and mission should be. Specific examples from GRN members will be used to show how to implement and promote reproducibility. There will also be enough space for social interaction and exchange.\n\n\nThe event will be held in English and will be conducted via the video conferencing tool Zoom. The seminar will not be recorded. Anyone interested is cordially inivited to join.\n\n\nTo participate in the event (free of charge), please register in advance:https://gfz-potsdam-de.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMocuiqrTgtH9dFDk7lSZ8m-mLp8c3rEpZR\n\n\nMore information and the (preliminary) program can be found on the homepage of the GRN.\n\n\nAbout the German Reproducibilty Network\n\n\nToday, it seems more important than ever that research results are trustworthy and based on robust research. This includes transparency and openness to enable the reproducibility of research results as a key quality indicator in research, which is also in line with established principles of good scientific practice. With this background eight key Open Science actors in Germany founded the German Reproducibility Network (GRN) in January 2021. The LMU Open Science Center was one of them. As a peer-led cross-disciplinary consortium the GRN is dedicated to promote reproducible and robust research on a national level in Germany. Therefore,  it focuses on activities like supporting researchers in educating themselves about open science practices, connecting local and topic-centered Reproducibility Initiatives or advise institutions on how to embed open science practices in their work. Moreover, it represents the open science community toward other stakeholders in the wider scientific landscape."

And when does an open exchange about it take place instead?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Dr. Julia M. Rohrer (University of Leipzig) below:\n\n\nLoss-of-Confidence Project – Have you ever lost faith in your scientific work?\n\n\nMistakes are a routine part of the scientific process, and yet we rarely talk about them openly. Imagine you published a paper only to realize that the central conclusion was wrong because of a mistake you made. How would you deal with that? And, if you spoke about it openly, how would the scientific community react?\n\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Julia M. Rohrer will talk about the Loss-of-Confidence Project in which a group of psychological researchers publicly owned their mistakes. You will hear from researchers who made a mess and made amends as well as learn more about why retractions should become normalized.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\n\nDr. Julia M. Rohrer is a personality psychologist by training and her work covers a broad range of topics, including the effects of birth order, age patterns in personality, and the correlates and determinants of subjective well-being. Her methodological interests include causal inference on the basis of observational data and data analytic flexibility. She is an active advocate for increased research transparency and has frequently given talks on the topic. Julia recently finished her doctoral degree as a fellow of the International Max Planck Research School on the Life Course and is now a lecturer (Akademische Assistentin) at the Department of Psychology, University of Leipzig.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproJucibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the name “ReproducibiliTea”. The slogan of the Journal-Club at LMU Munich is “ReproJuicebiliTea” matching the covered topics (Reproducibility & Open Science) and the extended selection of drinks. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, the meetings are hold online until it is possible to do them on site. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

Nevertheless, especially in the social sciences this “data work” is most often not directly subject to the scientific quality control, namely the review process of scholarly articles before publication. (How) Has this contributed to the so-called “replication crisis”, i.e. the fact that a lot of scientific findings cannot be reproduced? But what is replication and reproducibility? Is it really a crisis and if yes, how bad is it? How can the situation be improved and who can do it? These and many other questions will be addressed by Lars Vilhuber (https://www.vilhuber.com/lars) in his (English) presentation, which is organized by the Collaborative Research Center Transregio “Rationality and Competition” (https://rationality-and-competition.de/) and the LMU-ifo Economics & Business Data Center (https://www.cesifo-group.de/de/ifoHome/facts/EBDC.html) in collaboration with the LMU Open Science Center (https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/) and the LMU Center for Advanced Studies research focus “Evidence Based Practice” (https://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/research_focus/evidence_praxis/index.html).\n\n\nSpeaker:Dr. Lars Vilhuber is Executive Director of the Labor Dynamics Institute at CornellUniversity and the American Economic Association’s Data Editor.

Decisions by the FDA or EMA are typically made based on multiple primary studies testing the same medical product, where the two-trials rule is the standard requirement, despite a number of shortcomings. A new approach is proposed for this task based on the (weighted) harmonic mean of the squared study-specific test statistics. Appropriate scaling ensures that, for any number of studies, the null distribution is a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. Further properties are discussed and a comparison with the two-trials rule is made, as well as with alternative research synthesis methods. An attractive feature of the new approach is that a claim of success requires each study to be convincing on its own to a certain degree depending on the significance level and the number of studies. A real example with 5 clinical trials investigating the effect of Carvedilol for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe heart failure patients is used to illustrate the methodology. As a by-product, the approach provides a calibration of the sceptical p-value recently proposed for the analysis of replication studies.\n\n\nSpeaker:\n\n\nLeonhard Held is Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Zurich and Director of the Center for Reproducible Science."

They must invest considerable time to acquire the knowledge of what is even possible, before getting the skills required for reproducible research. This workshop gives researchers an overview of how to create reproducible data analyses in R (and beyond). Specifically, researchers will test, in a pre-set online environment, one way to automate the whole process from raw data to publishable manuscripts. This automation is possible by combining dynamic document generation (via R Markdown), version control (via Git), workflow orchestration (via Make) and software management (via Docker). These tools and, therefore, automatic reproduction of results are available on any machine with Docker installed. The resulting workflow is, hence, highly transferable across machines and time. These core properties of reproducibility are demonstrated for any reader by automatically reproducing the manuscript online via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nInstructor: Aaron Peikert, Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human DevelopmentFacilitators: Felix Henninger (Chair for Statistics and Data Science in Social Sciences and the Humanities, LMU), Malika Ihle (LMU Open Science Center coordinator)\n\n\nMaterials: https://aaronpeikert.github.io/repro-workshop/\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are researchers or graduate students working with R. Rough ideas of what Git, RMarkdown (or Jupiter), and the command line are can be helpful to follow this tech-savvy workshop.\n\n\nRequirement: Participants must bring their own laptop and have an internet connection.\n\n\nRelated Paper: https://doi.org/10.3390/psych3040053"

Julia’s user-friendly interface, resembling popular languages like R, Python, and Matlab, makes it easily accessible for learners. Its focus on performance, however, enables computational speeds that often rival, or even surpass, those of low-level languages such as C or Fortran. Therefore, Julia is an ideal choice for large-scale data analysis and other computationally intensive tasks, as it can be orders of magnitude faster than R or Python.\n\n\nIn this workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of Julia and the key features setting it apart from other languages.\n\n\nParticipants: This workshop is designed for R users who are interested in learning a new programming language or want to improve their skills in data analysis and scientific computing. No prior experience with Julia is required, but a understanding of R is recommended.\n\n\nInstructors: A team from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, the Max Planck School of Cognition, and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research will instruct this workshop: Dr. Aaron Peikert, post-doctoral fellow, Maximilian Ernst, PhD student, and Moritz Ketzer, PhD student."

Just a little spoiler: the goal of Open Science is to make science reproducible, open and accessible for everybody. Of course, we are also happy if people join us who are already experts in the field of Open Science, which will only make the discussion more interesting.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

I will briefly talk about the advantages of formal models over narrative ones, and present a few examples from my own lab in which such a formalization was attempted more or less successfully. However, the largest part of the workshop shall be reserved for participants working on formal versions of narrative theory paragraphs that they themselves pick and bring along. As this is likely to be a relatively new kind of challenge to most participants, and given that formalization can actually be fairly difficult, the overall objective is not to achieve perfect results, but rather to get people interested in this crucial type of work, and to help them overcome initial hesitations they may have to invest their valuable time and energy into it.\n\n\nTarget audience: scientists of all career levels (students to PIs) from the fields of psychology, philosophy, sociology, etc.\n\n\nAgenda: 60 m Intro ; 15 m Break ; 75 m First Round Practice ; 15 m Break ; 75 m Second Round Practice\n\n\nLogistics: There are no prerequisites. The format of the session is hybrid (you can attend online or in person). The event will be held in English, unless there are only German native speakers in the room. Participation in the workshop is free and open to all. Priority will be given to, in order, members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (Department of Psychology, Business Administration, Biology), other LMU members, and non-LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

In this flipped classroom workshop, we will help you solve the individual problems you have encountered when writing your own manuscript with Quarto.\n\n\nQuarto (the successor of R Markdown) is a popular open-source software for writing reproducible scientific manuscripts. It can also produce websites, blogs, books, presentations, dashboards and much more. Quarto can be used together with R, Python or Julia. If you want to learn how to use Quarto and write reproducible scientific manuscripts with R, we have prepared a self-paced online tutorial for you.\n\n\nBefore the workshop:\n\n\nIt is intended that you familiarize yourself with how Quarto works and have started your own reproducible manuscript before attending the workshop. If you have never worked with Quarto, R Markdown, or Jupyter Notebooks before, you should plan at least one workday for preparation. The following sections of the self-paced online tutorial are particularly relevant for you to be able to create a reproducible scientific manuscript:\n\n\n\nQuarto Tutorials: Companion to the beginner tutorials on the official Quarto website.\n\n\nExercise: APA 7 Manuscripts: An introduction to the Quarto extension apaquarto , which allows formatting Quarto documents as APA 7 manuscripts.\n\n\nOptional: Exercise: Quarto Manuscripts: Quarto Manuscripts enable you to create a website that showcases your manuscript and provides a bundle with all the code and materials necessary to reproduce your manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the workshop:\n\n\nThere will only be minimal input from our side during the workshop, as you have already familiarized yourself with Quarto beforehand so we can focus on your individual problems. After a brief welcome, we will collect the types of problems you encountered when trying to write your own manuscript and divide you into groups, so you can start helping each other. We will try to answer your individual questions and assist with the problems you encountered. When your problem is solved, you can continue working on your own manuscript during the workshop. We will wrap up with a short summary on commonly encountered challenges.\n\n\n \n\n\nTarget audience: Scientists and students who want to write a reproducible manuscript with Quarto and have started their first reproducible manuscript. If you have some experience with Quarto yourself and want to assist you colleagues during the workshop, you are very welcome as well!\n\n\nPrerequisites: Participants have worked through a Quarto tutorial before the workshop, have started to write their own manuscript in Quarto and have encountered questions or unsolved problems.\n\n\nMax. number of participants: Until the room is full"

One of the best ways to make research open is the use of version control systems (VCS). Their use allows for a transparent process in science and data analysis. At the same time, VCS are excellent tools for data management, project planning and collaborative work. The course will cover the essential concepts about Version Control Systems, and will focus in the use of git, the most used VCS at the moment. Students will learn how to use git locally and how to work with git repositories, specifically their git repository gitlab offered by the LRZ to all members of the Munich universities. This course will be a combination of practice and theory, with emphasis on the practical aspect to facilitate the application of all acquired knowledge to their everyday scientific work. These basic concepts will allow students to explore more advanced features required for collaborative work. With this course we aim to offer a new tool to all interested in Open Science.\n\n\n \n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\n\nWillingness to work with the command-line (Unix systems)/ power shell (windows OS).\n\n\nSoftware: Unix system access (Windows with the Linux App, MacOS or Linux distro) and a text editor. For installation in Windows we will send a guide before the course with helpful information.\n\n\nHardware: Personal computer (laptop) with 64-bit architecture and wlan connection.\n\n\nAccess to Eduroam / LRZ system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget audience: Members of the Medical and Biology Faculty interested in learning the git version control system using the command line. However, depending on inscriptions, participation priority will be given to Medical faculty members (Principal investigators, Medical students, Postgraduate students and Postdoctoral fellows).\n\n\nTime required: 3 hours on-site, 2 hours preparation at home.\n\n\nCredits: Credit for the curriculum as part of the degree (Module 6) and doctorate (Dr. med., Dr. med. dent., Dr. hum. biol., Dr. rer. nat. and PhD in Medical Research) is possible. See www.med.uni-muenchen.de. ECTS credits can be awarded for the PhD program Public Health & Epidemiology if the course is combined with other short courses."

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the importance of good quality working conditions for high quality reserach. There will be a short introduction into a paper by Rahul’s et al. that discusses ways to redesign academic systems, emphasizing the role of permanent employment. Then there will be room for a discussion.\n\n\nProcedure: One member of our organising team will introduce (approx. 20 minutes). We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

You are invited to apply for one or both tracks. For either track, you can choose to participate either online or in-person.\nTrack 1: Open Science knowledge and skills\nIn this track, early career researchers who are Open Science novices learn to make their research more transparent, reproducible and credible in the eyes of their peers, the public, and funding agencies. This track consists of public lectures accessible to anyone as well as hands-on practical workshops for selected applicants and extends from Monday 15.09.2025 9:00 to Friday 19.09.2025 14:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nSpecify research design and set up statistical plans in advance of collecting data to prevent biases in analyses, with the help of preregistration and data simulation.\nCreate computationally reproducible workflows to be more efficient and spot mistakes in data wrangling or analyses, through programming with version controlled scripts.\nPrepare and share data and code in connection with manuscripts by applying the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles, and using adequate repositories and licenses to accumulate credit and citations.\n\nTrack 2: Open Science instructor training\nIn this track, early career researchers or research support staff interested in becoming Open Science instructors develop essential pedagogical skills to promote Open Science through teaching - no prior experience in teaching required. This track extends from Friday 19.09.2025 14:30 to 17:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nDesign and deliver Open Science workshops, and apply basic didactic techniques to diverse audiences.\nApply activation methods in the classroom to foster motivation and attention.\nDevelop skills to advocate for Open Science, to lead research groups and discussions around Open Science, and to analyse the potential challenges and issues around the implementation of Open Science practices.\n\nAfter joining this track, you will have the opportunity to put your new skills into practice and co-deliver a workshop at LMU to become a certified Open Science instructor.\n\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\nLaura Meier\n\n\nMaximilian Frank\n\n\nFlorian Kohrt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpers\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact \n\nOSC team\n\n."

A. Ioannidis, Professor of Medicine, of Health Research and Policy, of Biomedical Data Science, and of Statistics, Stanford University; Co-director, Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS)\n\n\nAbstract: Theoretical insights, simulations, and empirical data converge that in the current research environment a substantial segment of published research yields results that are not credible. Moreover, among the results that are credible a large share cannot be translated meaningfully and thus end up being not useful. The lecture will assess the scope of this evidence and will focus on solutions that have been proposed to make research more reproducible and with greater translational impact. Many of these solutions center around optimizing transparency. Transparency can clearly help reproducibility, but this alone may not suffice to make research outcomes also more useful. Different solutions will be discussed with emphasis on biomedical and social sciences, although the challenges cover all scientific fields and comparative data will be presented across different fields.\n\n\nSpeaker:Prof. John P.

Für manche ist Publizieren zu einer finanziellen Herausforderung geworden. An vielen Fakultäten wird daher intensiv über den Umgang mit diesen Kosten und über das kommerzielle Publikationssystem im Allgemeinen diskutiert. Das LMU Open Science Center möchte mit dieser Veranstaltung eine Plattform bieten, um drei Aspekte zu beleuchten und zu diskutieren:\n\n\nTeil I (16:00–17:00; hybrid) – Nachgefragt: Status Quo von DEAL & Co. und Handhabung der Publikationskosten an der LMUVeronika Reinertshofer von der Universitätsbibliothek erläutert den aktuellen Stand der DEAL-Verträge, räumt typische Missverständnisse aus und beantwortet Ihre Fragen. Außerdem zeigen wir praxisorientiert auf, wie Sie im bestehenden System möglichst offen publizieren – von den OA-Fördermitteln der LMU bis zu „Green Open Access“.\n\n\nTeil II (17:00–18:00; hybrid) – Weitergedacht: Modelle jenseits von DEAL und die Rückgewinnung wissenschaftlicher AutonomieWir zeigen Best-Practice-Beispiele wie gemeinwohlorientierte Infrastrukturen aufgebaut werden können und beleuchten internationale Trends, welche Rolle Fachcommunities und Hochschulen beim Publizieren ohne kommerzielle Verlage spielen könnten. Prof. Markus Gebhardt (LMU) berichtet von der Gründung eines Diamond-OA-Journals an der LMU, Prof. Felix Schönbrodt (LMU) wird die “Peer Community In (PCI)” Plattform vorstellen, welche bereits in vielen Disziplinen eine Qualitätssicherung durch Peer Review nicht-kommerziell organisiert. Prof. Björn Brembs (Universität Regensburg) diskutiert, wie traditionelle Journals gänzlich durch dezentrale und resiliente Infrastrukturen ersetzt werden können, die durch Interoperabilität und offene Standards vernetzt sind.\n\n\nOptionaler Teil III (18:00–19:00; nur vor Ort) – Vernetzt vor Ort: Konkrete Schritte für die LMUVertreterinnen und Vertreter verschiedener Fakultäten tauschen sich über die jeweilige Betroffenheit der einzelnen Disziplinen aus und erörtern etwaige Überlegungen / Strategien auf Instituts-/Fakultätsebene. Sie diskutieren in dem Rundgespräch Handlungsspielräume im aktuellen System, Wünsche an zukünftige Verhandlungsrunden sowie Strategien, um statt symptomorientierter Maßnahmen nachhaltige Systemveränderungen anzustoßen.\n\n\nDa die Platzzahl vor Ort limitiert ist, ist eine vorherige Anmeldung notwendig, insbesondere für Personen, die auch an Teil III teilnehmen wollen. Eine Teilnahme an Teil I und II ist online ohne Platzbeschränkung möglich."

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the current Debates about Registered Reports. This week, we are very happy to host Gilad Feldman as our guest. He is an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong and conducts research in the field of social psychology and decision making. Additionally he has taken special interest in the movement for improvement of psychological science to implement and promote open-science and meta-research. Together with him we will discuss the format of Registered Reports and its prospects as well as limitations. You can find the recommended article and a short abstract about the topic of the session below.\n\n\nProcedure: Dr. Gilad Feldman will introduce (approx. 20 minutes) the article. We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nAbstract: The article discusses the value and impact of Registered Reports, a publication format that addresses reporting and publication biases by pre-accepting study proposals that went through rigorous peer review. It reflects on the history and progress of Registered Reports, provides practical guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, and presents early evidence of their effectiveness. While acknowledging their limitations, the article highlights the potential of Registered Reports to promote reproducibility, transparency, and self-correction in research.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFinia Loeb, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

Assuming that all listeners are familiar with ‘The preregistration revolution’ (Nosek et al., 2018, PNAS), after a brief introduction to the rationale for multiverse analysis, I will argue in this talk that the two proposed tools for the credibility revolution (pre-registration and multiverse analysis) should be used together.\n\n\nInstructor: Andrea Hildebrandt, Professor for Psychological Methods and Statistics at the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Department of Psychology\n\n\nParticipants: Researchers from all quantitative fields, all career stages\n\n\nLogistics: There are no prerequisites.

Accordingly, researchers should not only make research results freely available, for example in the form of scientific articles (open access), but also provide research data, analysis scripts and study materials. However, the reusability of the data made available requires comprehensive research data management (RDM) on the part of the researchers. In particular, research data should be made available in accordance with the FAIR principles, meaning that research data should be Findable, Accessible, and usable (Interoperable and Reusable). In this workshop, you will learn about FAIR data management in the social sciences. Specifically, you will 1) create a data management plan and 2) get an introduction to FAIR data documentation.\n\n\nTarget audience: PhD students and post-docs from the social sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc). However, interested students are also welcome.\n\n\nPrerequisites: There is no prior knowledge required on research data management or the implementation of the FAIR principles. To participate in the hands-on session on data management planning, please create an account for the DMPTool https://dmptool.org/ if you do not already have one.\n\n\nLogistics: This event will be held online. Priority will be given to LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

Another important, but underrated, aspect is that researchers – even statisticians – tend to disregard important epistemic foundations of statistics. This lack of principle (or knowledge) effectively contributes to questionable research practices, statistical rituals, delusions and fallacies about what statistics and science can achieve. In the age of big data and foundation models, the importance of these topics is greater than ever before.\n\n\nWith keynotes by select speakers and ample time for discussion, we will address the question why the inappropriate use of statistical methods (most prominently, statistical testing) is still so prevalent, despite warnings that have been voiced for decades.\n\n\nKeynote talks:\n\n\n\nSabina Leonelli (TU Munich), was recently appointed Professor for Philosophy and History of Science and Technology at TUM. She works on the philosophy of data-intensive science; in particular, the impact of big and open data on research and society in general.\n\n\nUwe Saint-Mont (HS Nordhausen),  holds a chair at the Department of Economics and Social Sciences. He works on statistical theory, philosophy of statistics, and philosophy of science.\n\n\n\nOther talks:\n\n\n\nWalter Radermacher (Advisory Board on Ethics of the International Statistical Institute and LMU Munich), is a Professor of Statistics at LMU. Additionally, he serves as the Advisory Board Chair of the International Statistical Institute (ISI). Furthermore, he has experience in public administration at national and European levels, having served as President of the German Statistical Office (destatis), Director General of Eurostat and Chief Statistician of the European Union, and Chair of the destatis Commission Future Statistics. He works on statistics, sustainable development, governance, ethics, and data analysis.\n\n\nRudolf Seising (Deutsches Museum), currently chairs the BMBF research project “Eine Geschichte der KI in der BRD”. He works on the history of science and artificial intelligence.\n\n\nMichael Schomaker (LMU Munich), is a Professor for Biostatistics working under the German Research Foundation’s Heisenberg Program. He works on the appropriate use of modern causal inference methods.\n\n\n\nRegistration:\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation is open to everyone and free of charge. Seats will be given on a first-register, first-serve basis.\n\n\nTo join the discussion, please register at https://www.pretix.osc.lmu.de/lmu-osc/osis2024/ by October 31st.\n\n\nThe current program allows some room for further talks – please reach out to epix.workshop@stat.uni-muenchen.de if you would like to add your perspective to the workshop.\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing you at EPIX!\n\n\nContact:\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact epix.workshop@stat.uni-muenchen.de."

Based on the experiences at Charité and BIH, we will elaborate in small groups (breakout rooms) on the following aspects of an implementation strategy: field and need assessment, stakeholder engagement, design of a new incentive, capacity building. The topics will be discussed with reference to the institutional environment at LMU.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the workshop, we kindly invite all members to the General Assembly of the LMU Open Science Center, including all representatives from our institutional members.\n\n\nSince 2018, the center aims at fostering the engagement for open, transparent, and reproducible research. This goal is supported by research on research, training of researchers, and addressing relevant committees in order to create new and innovative incentive structures for open science. We are always looking for new members. If you are interested, please take a look at our admission requirements for more information."

The Carpentries is a non-profit, community-led organisation, which specialises in teaching basic Software, Data, or Library skills to researchers of all career stages and across disciplines, in an inclusive environment. By training trainers to teach reproducible tools that increase integrity, credibility, and reuse, this partnership will foster the expansion of the open science community in Munich.\n\n\nAs part of the institutional membership, we are able to offer training, free of charge, for 15 members (students or staff) of the LMU and TUM Universities to qualify as instructors for The Carpentries. Five of these seats are reserved in priority for MCML members. The training involves attendance of a 16-hour online event, followed by a simple check-out process. Applicants are expected to already know or be willing to learn on their own at least one of the practical skills they would teach in their future workshops (e.g. R and/or Python and/or Unix Shell and/or Git, and/or Open Refine and/or SQL, etc.), as the instructor training will focus on the didactics around teaching said skill(s). Certified instructors will then be able to help deliver Software, Data, or Library Carpentry workshops using the existing open source training material from the Carpentries, for example by co-teaching a workshop for their research group, department, or in a Faculty where computing skills training isn’t currently part of official curricula. We expect newly trained instructors to be involved in the delivery of at least one workshop in LMU or TU Munich within 12 months of completing the training.\n\n\nIf interested, please read the information below and fill out this application form. If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with the OSC coordinator, Dr. Malika Ihle (malika.ihle@lmu.de), or the MCML open science transfer coordinator, Dr. Moritz Herrmann (moritz.herrmann@stat.uni-muenchen.de).\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nApplication deadline: 13 November 2023, 08:00 CET\n\n\nInstructor training: Those offered a place are encouraged to attend the online training as soon as possible, from November 2023. Participation for the whole duration of the training is required. This 16-hour event can take place over 2 or 4 days. Minimally two sessions are provided each month, and new dates are shared every quarter. Please see the training calendar for upcoming sessions.\n\n\nWorkshop delivery: We expect newly trained instructors to be involved in the delivery of at least one Carpentries workshop at the LMU or TU Munich within one year of completing the training.\n\n\nEligibility criteria\n\n\nThis call is aimed at postgraduate research students, research staff or fellows, and research support staff from any department, who expect to be based in Munich at least through the end of June 2025.\n\n\nSelection criteria\n\n\nPlaces will be allocated in line with the goal of building a sustainable community of instructors based in Munich. Criteria include:\n\n\n\ncareer stage, motivation, and experience (i.e., balance between early-career researchers interested in building a community of peers, and permanent university staff already involved in training);\n\n\nrepresentation across Faculties (i.e., balance between disciplines with high demand for training in computing skills, and disciplines with limited training opportunities in this area);\n\n\nprevious involvement with the LMU Open Science Center and/or with The Carpentries (both favoured, but not necessary);\n\n\na commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, to ensure that all future workshop participants are able to access training in a welcoming environment.\n\n\n\nWe warmly encourage recent practitioners of software, data or library skills (e.g. students or early career researchers), and members who identify with groups that have been historically excluded from computer science and related fields (e.g., women, people of colour and/or from ethnic minority backgrounds, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community) to apply.\n\n\nAre you already a certified Carpentries instructor and want to contribute to the teaching of future workshops? Email malika.ihle@lmu.de to be added to our local instructors mailing list!"

There are many ways scientific misconduct and questionable research practices undermine trust in science, including number nudging, cherry-picking, abstract spin, plagiarism, or pure data fabrication. During the last decade, however, we witnessed an unprecedented and concerning kind of misconduct: Industry-style, semi-automatic production of fake scientific publications by so-called “paper mills”, professional agencies that fake scientific data, figures, tables, and manuscripts including most recently artificial intelligence. While the number of publications with fake science is generally considered to be small, their number has scaled up and reaches concerning levels in some fields (medicine est. 200,000 annually), supporting a billion EURO paper mill business model. It should be considered a systematic criminal attack on the permanent scientific record (Sabel & Seifert 2021). The symposium sheds light on this new phenomenon and provides a discussion forum for the perspectives of researchers, editors, and publishers.\n\n\n\n“Fake science publications by paper-mills: pollution of the permanent scientific record” by Bernhard Sabel (Director, Inst. of Medical Psychology, Univ.

Multiple initiatives call for developing alternatives to existing metrics that better reflect quality (instead of quantity) in research assessment.” (https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.8162)\n\n\nA number of themes run through the recommendations of initiatives such as The Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, https://sfdora.org/) and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA, https://coara.eu/):\n\n\n\nthe need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, in funding, appointment, and promotion considerations;\n\n\nthe need to assess research on its own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which the research is published; and\n\n\nthe need to recognise the diverse outputs, practices, and activities that maximise the quality and impact of research\n\n\n\nAs of 12 January 2023, 441 organisations (including European Commission, League of European Research Universities, European University Association, Science Europe, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) e.V., Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie) have signed the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment. The signatories agree to define an action plan within the year.\n\n\nWith these developments, it is evident that profound changes will come in how academic achievements will be evaluated, both in hiring and in funding decisions. But how can we practically implement and evaluate a reformed research assessment? What will be the consequences for researchers from signing institutions or applying for signatory funding agencies? How to ensure a smooth transition for early-career researchers? And how can we reconcile diverse needs across disciplines? To address these questions, the LMU Open Science Center is inviting you to a symposium, with short presentations followed by a panel discussion.\n\n\n\nProf Dr Toma Susi (CoARA Steering Board Member, University of Vienna) will present the Agreement and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment.\n\n\nProf Dr Kristin Mitte (Vice President Research & Development, Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena) will share her views on how societal impact and translation of research constitute important evaluative dimensions in the applied sciences.\n\n\nDr Tobias Grimm (Head of Division Life Sciences II, German Research Foundation (DFG) head office) will present the DFG’s approach to reforming research assessment.\n\n\nDr Jess Rohmann (Scientific Strategic Advisor in the Scientific Director’s Office at the Max Delbrück Center in Berlin) will present the perspective of Early-Career Researchers and an overview of recent actions taken in selected Berlin Institutions (Charité/BIH, Max Delbrück Center).\n\n\nProf Dr Felix Schönbrodt (Managing Director of the LMU Open Science Center) will present the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie’s working group proposal for practical implementation, for the field of psychology in Germany (see https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.8162 and https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5yexm).\n\n\n\nThe event will be chaired by Dr Heidi Seibold, Open and Reproducible Data Science Consultant, and Associate Member of the LMU Open Science Center."

The organisation team is happy to announce that one of the paper’s and the position paper’s authors, Maximilian Frank, will give an introductory talk to this session and participate in the open discussion afterwards:\n\n\nParticipants can use the following key questions to prepare for the discussion:\n\n\n\nHow prevalent are the different QRPs among students and what are the reasons for these prevalence rates?\n\n\nWhat further changes are needed in the curricula (of your discipline) in order to meet the demands for transparency and/or address the problems related to the replication crisis (in social sciences) adequately in the education of students?\n\n\nWhat is the best way to implement changes in curricula on a broad scale? What can and should be done at local level and what role do structural/political changes play?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Maximilian Frank below:\n\n\nOpen Science knowledge and prevalence of QRPs among students - a call to update our curricula\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been an intensive debate within psychology about the conclusions that should be drawn from the replication crisis. The use of questionable research practices (QRPs) was identified as one reason for problems concerning replicability. While there are extensive studies on the prevalence of QRPs among scientists, little is known about their occurrence among students. In his introduction, Maximilian Frank presents the results of the first large scale survey amongst psychology students conducted by the Open Science Working Group of the PsyFaKo. In this study, 1,397 psychology students in the German-speaking countries were surveyed to investigate the occurrence of QRPs in student projects and to assess the current state of academic teaching regarding the replication crisis and open science practices. Based on these findings we will discuss impulses for the development of teaching and have a look in the related positions papers of the PsyFaKo. The principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration need to play an important role in the academic teaching and are part of a generational change in the academic education of students.\n\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\n\nMaximilian Frank studied psychology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich and graduated in the interdisciplinary master’s program Human Factors in Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. Since 2022 heis a doctoral candidate in the DFG priority program “META-REP” and conducts research on heterogeneity estimations in meta-analyses. As coordinator of the Open Science Working Group of the Psychologie-Fachschaften-Konferenz (PsyFaKo) he is committed to open research practices and their communication in academic teaching.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

So werden Preprints oft ohne Begutachtungsverfahren zur Kenntnis genommen oder mit stark beschleunigten Verfahren in Journals publiziert. Offene Publikationen erhöhen zwar die Quantität der vorliegenden Forschung; ohne Qualitätsstandards und Kontrollen sind sie aber womöglich zu stark verzerrt, um hinreichend verlässliche Ergebnisse zu liefern. Der Beitrag illustriert das mit Beispielen aus der Medizin und insbesondere den Sozialwissenschaften, wie etwa arg „freihändig“ formulierten Thesen oder ad-hoc Surveys. Damit sich verlässliche wieder gegenüber überhasteter Forschung durchsetzen kann, scheinen Änderungen der Anreizstrukturen erforderlich. Die zentrale zu diskutierende These lautet hier: Open Science hilft durch offene Daten und transparente Materialien. Lediglich Open Access zu nicht oder rasch begutachteten Publikationen ist dagegen kein effizientes Mittel für einen effizienten Erkenntnisfortschritt, eher im Gegenteil.\n\n\nFolien:\n\n\nFoliensatz_Fieberhafte Forschung_OSC-Kolloquium"

While more and more researchers actively choose to make their research data open, dedicated strategies for data management are required by funding agencies such as the European Commission, the DFG and BMBF. In the EU’s new framework program Horizon Europe, Open Science is mandatory for all projects.In this interactive workshop, the LMU Open Science Center, the Unit for Research Funding and the University Library join forces to present an overview on recent trends, funding requirements and services available at LMU. The workshop will be kicked off with a primer on the current discussions surrounding open data by Felix Schönbrodt, followed by a presentation by the Research Funding Unit on the policies of funders such as the German Research Foundation (DFG), BMBF and the European Commission, with a special focus on presenting data management and open data in the application. It will close with a hands-on presentation of online resources and tools that support researchers from creating data management plans to implementing effective data management workflows for their projects, including possible storage and open access strategies by the LMU University Library.\n\n\nPS: After the workshop, the biannual members’ meeting of the LMU Open Science Center will take place (from 5pm to 6pm). Participants of the workshop who are interested in the work of the OSC are cordially invited to join the members meeting as guests.\n\n\nSpeakers:\n\n\n\nProf. Dr. Felix Schönbrodt, LMU Open Science Center (OSC)\n\n\nDr. Florian Schneck & Dr. Veit Schwab, LMU Unit for Research Funding\n\n\nLaura Meier, Dr. Martin Spenger, LMU University Library"

The organisation team is happy to announce that the paper’s author, Prof. Dr. Chris Donkin, will give an introductory talk to this session and participate in the open discussion afterwards:\n\n\nParticipants can use the following key questions to prepare for the discussion:\n\n\n\nHow might the flexiblity of theories contribute to replicability problems?\n\n\nWhat are the characteristics of good theories?\n\n\nIs preregistration misguided to prevent QRPs? What could be arguments for and against such an opinion?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Prof. Dr. Chris Donkin below:\n\n\nBetter theory development as a response to the prevalence of QRPs\n\n\nConcerns about so-called QRPs, and especially p-hacking, are typically based on concerns about false-positive statistical outcomes. However, the outcome of a statistical test is not equivalent to a scientific claim, and so elevated Type-I error rates do not speak directly to reduced replicability. We will explain why certain kinds of statistical analyses, including those forms of p-hacking that seem most egregious, will indeed lead to an inability to predict the outcome of future experiments. The problem, simply put, is that without sufficient scientific argument, any statistical analysis taken at face value is an ad hoc explanation, from which there is no good reason to expect to understand the world. We contrast such explanations with good theories and discuss what those are. Thinking about p-hacking from this perspective helps provide a way of deciding what kinds of analyses are good or bad, independent of whether they are p-hacked, ‘exploratory’, or ‘confirmatory’. \n\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\n\nChris Donkin is a Professor of Computational Modelling in Psychology at LMU Munich. His work focuses on explaining cognitive phenomena, such as memory and decision-making, often relying on using mathematical and computational models as aids to help understand and test our theories.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers.

Which questions do you think are not answered by the scientific community, yet (both empirical questions e.g. specific prevalence rates and theoretical questions)?\n\n\n\nYou can find a short abstract for the introductory talk by Angelika Stefan (University of Amsterdam) below:\n\n\nBig Little Lies: p-hacking and effective countermeasures\n\n\nA decade ago, John et al. (2012) found a high prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs) among psychological researchers. This result was confirmed by many other surveys among researchers in the social sciences. QRPs range from accidental mistakes to clear scientific misconduct and its prevalence undermined the credibility of the social sciences. One of the most prominent QRPs is p-hacking which includes a broad range of different strategies to render non-significant testing results significant. But if QRPs and especially p-hacking are widespread, as previous research suggests: How problematic are the different strategies in fact? How big is the impact of different p-hacking-strategies in detail? And what countermeasures are most effective?\n\n\nIn this talk, Angelika Stefan will give a short, general introduction to QRPs. She will discuss p-hacking in more detail and distinguish it from other QRPs. Then, she will show some examples of simulations from this session’s paper that examined the impact of different p-hacking strategies. Based on the simulations’ results, possible countermeasures and solutions will be introduced and discussed.\n\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\n\nAngelika Stefan is a researcher and doctoral candidate at the University of Amsterdam and belongs to the Department of Psychological Methods within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. She finished her Masters in Economic, Organizational and Social Psychology in 2018 at LMU Munich. Her work focuses on the application of Bayesian Statistics and the general dealing with methodological flexibility in the Social Sciences. She is an expert for Open Science, led many workshops on Open Science-related topics and organizes the ReproducibiliTea at her university in Amsterdam.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings.

We will then continue with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nIt would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so. If you do not have time to read the entire paper, we recommend that you focus on the end of the article, which begins with the heading “Moving Forward” (pages 1303-1306). This part contains a brief summary of the previous sections as well as the author’s recommendations (e.g. including positionality statements in publications). We prepared the following key questions to guide you through the discussion and also provide some guidance while reading the paper. For each question, you can think about the suggestions from the paper, but also bring in your own ideas:\n\n\n\nWhich information could (and should) be included in positionality statements?\n\n\nWhat possible problems are the positionality statements aimed at? What other measures could help to solve these problems?\n\n\nIn which concrete way would the introduction of (mandatory) positionality statements change the scientific system and the scientific way of generating knowledge? What might be negative/positive consequences?\n\n\n\nBelow, you can find a short abstract for the session.\n\n\nPositionality statements - Should authors be more transparent about themselves?\n\n\nFollowing the theme of this year’s Journal Club “Pushing Open Science to its limits”, the upcoming session is dedicated to a less common open research practice that may be of particular interest in the social sciences. In positionality statements, authors describe their own connection to the research topic/question. They might make aspects of theirown identity transparent (e.g. belonging to an ethnic group) or explain their interest in the topic. For example, researchers examining aspects of discrimination against a particular group could inform readers whether or not they themselves belong to the discriminated group. So far, this method has been more common among qualitative researchers, where it is often part of the researcher’s general reflection on the methods used. Recently - also in the context of social, anti-discriminatory and epistemological debates - calls have been made to include such statements in quantitative research as well. In this session we want to briefly introduce the idea of such statements and openly discuss possible advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings.

In einigen Disziplinen gibt es zentrale Datenbanken, mit denen die Fachcommunity vertraut ist, in anderen Fächern sind Datensätze nur schwer zu lokalisieren, da es nur wenige Nachweisinstrumente gibt. In dieser Veranstaltung geht es weniger um die konkrete Suche nach speziellen Datensätzen und –banken. Vielmehr soll ein allgemeiner Überblick über die nach wie vor bestehenden Probleme bei der Datenrecherche und potenziell nützliche Nachweisinstrumente gegeben werden.Sprache: deutschTeilnahmebedingungen: für Bibliotheksmitarbeitende der FAU und LMURegistrierung: https://www.studon.fau.de/crs4923482.html (FAU), per E-Mail an Beschäftigte (UB der LMU)Durchgeführt von: UB FAU (Dr. Jürgen Rohrwild)\n\n\nDatenmanagementpläne einfach erstellen mit RDMO\n\n\nDonnerstag, 16.02.2023 15:00 – 16:00 UhrAbstract: Die strukturierte Planung eines Forschungsvorhabens und die Verwaltung der eigenen Daten bringen im Forschungsalltag viele Vorteile mit sich. Worauf man bei der Erstellung eines Datenmanagementplans achten muss und wie webbasierte Werkzeuge wie der Research Data Management Organizer (RDMO) zur Arbeitserleichterung eingesetzt werden können, wird in dieser Veranstaltung gezeigt.Sprache: deutschTeilnahmebedingungen: öffentlich und für alle ZielgruppenRegistrierung: https://lmu-munich.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMuf-mrrzoiGdZFwCNMHVT7tm2qVnE0mb6cDurchgeführt von: UB der LMU (Laura Meier, Vanessa Gabriel)\n\n\nIntroduction to Open Data and RDM Services at LMU\n\n\nFreitag, 17.02.2023 10:00 – 12:00 UhrAbstract: The workshop is kicked off with an introduction on the relevance of Open Research Data by the Open Science Center.

During my career I have come to understand how essential is openness into the scientific process, and how much it can help it to spur. I work with numerical simulations to recreate observations, in order to understand the physical processes at the base of planet formation. Many details can be hidden under the carpet, both from the observational and numerical side. In my work I am trying to explain all the assumptions made during my work, and I am planning to render more public all the codes and data used during the simulations and in the post-processing phase."

I am convinced that this is best achieved by Open Science. This requires that the FAIR principles are not only applied to data, but also the to the whole infrastructure required for the analysis of the data, including in particular the software. I have led a task force to established an Open Source Software Policy at the international Belle II collaboration and taken care of the publication of its main software. I am also working on technologies that facilitate the reuse and reinterpretation of data."

Back the time of my psychology studies, I was lucky to be assigned to emprical course (EmPra) in which we conducted a replication of an existing study. This was my first point of contact with the topic replication crisis and the many proposals for reforming science that can be summarized under the term \"Open Science\". Since then, the topic has stuck with me and I have consequently become involved in several Open Science initiatives. Personally, in addition to a transparent and reproducible work process in my own research, I am engaged in teaching Open Science practices to students and early career researchers. They are the scientists of the future, which is why we owe them a state-of-the-art education which covers these important topics to benefit science as a whole."

That’s why two of my colleagues and I founded a journal club back in 2019, in which we discuss papers and topics around Open Science. I am convinced that the Open Science movement will be most successful if we talk about it, discuss it, inform about it and support local initiatives."

We employ advanced statistics, machine learning and computer vision techniques in the context of clinical radiology to enable fast and precise AI-supported diagnosis and prognostication. Open science and reproducible research in this field is highly relevant, especially with deep learning or machine learning. While it is easy to share analyses and code, the sensitive nature of medical images and associated clinical data poses challenges with respect of public data sharing. I believe the Open Science Center provides the ideal framework to address these challenges."

I am trying to get out of the cycle taught to me. Open Science is unusual but challenging at the same time. We get to see what we should keep and what we should change from the old science way. For what I have seen, the change is difficult but the tools are there. We just need to learn them and make them public and accessible for the community. That is what I am trying to do every day with my students, my colleagues and all who want to listen. All what I am learning I am making it public in YouTube, so that others have an easier transition. My area of research is infection biology. We really need Open Science and FAIR data principles to understand the real relationship of microorganism with humans and environment."

In particular, I am always on the look out for new methods that can streamline data processing and documentation, statistical models that can help us assess the degree of certainty of empirical results, and principles that can assist us in the formulation of statistical hypotheses that map more tightly to the research questions."

To foster open science practices, I teamed up with colleagues and established our department's \"Open Science Committee\" in 2015. The outcomes of this committee include an open science paragraph which we included in all recent professorship job descriptions, adding transparency criteria to the department's performance-based funding system, or introducing modules on preregistrations, open data, and reproducible scripts as mandatory components in undergraduate courses.\n\nTogether with the board of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) I developed the society's recommendations for data sharing in psychology [English version]. In 2016, I received the Leamer-Rosenthal-Prize for Open Social Science from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)."
