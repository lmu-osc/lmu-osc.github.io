    "text": "Becoming an OSC member\n\n\nIndividual Members\nAccording to its statute, the OSC has three categories of individual membership. Individual members express that they actively support the goals of the OSC. Beyond this, we encourage members to become ‘ambassadors’ of open research practices in whatever capacity they find suitable, e.g. contribute in delivering training events or seminars, contribute in community building, get involved in meta-research projects, or liaise with stakeholders to inform on the design of incentives and policies. Only OSC members can vote for and take part in the OSC Scientific Board.\n\n    \n      \n        Full Members\n        University teachers of the LMU (i.e., professors and PDs)\n      \n      \n        Extraordinary Members\n        Other researchers of the LMU (e.g., post-docs and lecturers that do not fall into the first category)\n      \n      \n        Affiliate Members\n        Researchers from other universities or non-university research institutes, who have a close collaboration with the LMU and who contribute to foster the goals of the OSC\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\nOSC Fellows\n\n\nIn addition, we acknowledge the volunteer contributions of phd students and other students from the LMU who (co-)lead grassroot initiatives, organise events and/or (co-)deliver workshops with OSC staff or members, by offering them the status of OSC Fellows and providing them with further leadership or training opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional Members\n\n\nDepartments, faculties, units, or central institutions of the LMU that provide infrastructure or other services that facilitate the goals of the OSC can become institutional members.

With a focus on improving experimental design, documentation, and data management, BMC aims to adhere to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable). Initial efforts include raising awareness among researchers, training in doctoral programs, and evaluating the effectiveness of these measures. Current activities involve participation in Responsible Research Days and integration of Open Science concepts into doctoral programs. Looking ahead, BMC plans to implement Open Science practices institute-wide over the next five years, including creating guidelines and checklists for researchers.

Through creating an interdisciplinary network of excellent research with strong international connections, MCN and GSN provide a stimulating environment for students and faculty to produce novel formulations of current concepts and theories.\n      Since 2005, MCN and GSN have become the hub for neuroscience research and education in the Munich area. Our commitment to excellence sets high standards for researchers, who strive for quality and replicability. \n      The Scientific Boards of MCN and GSN have long supported courses and events on responsible science and good scientific practice. At the institutional level, the most recent commitment to the LMU open science initiative will be enhanced by outreach and interdisciplinary dialogue, engaging GSN’s 147 faculty, more than 220 current students, as well as over 230 alumni, and 100 MCN members, respectively. Long-standing routines such as the Thesis Advisory Committees (TAC) for all doctoral researchers complement any further actions toward scientific integrity.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Universitätsbibliothek\n        \n        \n        \n              Website\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n       The University Library supports Open Access and Open Science and offers a variety of related services for all LMU faculties."

Building on the previous Excellence Cluster Universe, a very fruitful collaboration between astro-, particle- and nuclear physicists, ORIGINS is exploring the conjecture of modern cosmology that the Universe and the emergence of life have naturally unfolded from the initial conditions laid out in the Big Bang. Open Science under FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets) principles has a long tradition in astrophysics and is showing increased activity in particle physics. The ORIGINS Data Science Lab (ODSL) was founded as a pillar for novel statistical data analysis and artificial intelligence in all ORIGINS (bio-)physics and chemistry disciplines. As a part of ODSL, the Dark Matter Data Centre (DMDC) provides an open science repository for dark matter-related experimental data, numerical simulations and related software to improve accessibility within the dark matter community.\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Cluster of Excellence: SyNergy\n        Contact Person: \n        Prof. Dr. Martin Dichgans\n        \n              Website\n        \n    \n\n\n\n  \n    The Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy) investigates how complex neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis develop. Using systems neurology as a new interdisciplinary approach, researchers can decipher the shared disease mechanisms of neurovascular, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases and on this basis develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. SyNergy has expressed its commitment to promoting research transparency and reproducibility in both quantitative and qualitative research endeavors. We view the ability to replicate and reproduce research findings, whether quantitative or qualitative, as fundamental pillars supporting the generalizability and reliability of scientific knowledge.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Department of Psychology\n        Contact Person: \n        Prof. Dr. Felix Schönbrodt\n        \n              Website\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n      Psychological science has seen a substantial replication crisis in the last years, with many large scale projects failing to replicate apparently well established findings. With the goal to increase the awareness and the adoption of open science practices, in July 2015 an Open Science Committee was established at the Department Psychology. Its project on the Open Science Framework (OSF) provides different documents and presentations that are used in research and teaching. Furthermore, since 2016 all job descriptions for professorship positions at our department included an \"Open Science track record\" as desirable characteristic of an applicant. Additionally, we decided to require a PhD/Dissertation agreement between all PhD students and their supervisors that includes planned open science practices. A template for this kind of agreement is provided on our website\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Faculty of Biology\n        Contact Person: \n        Prof. Dr. Niels Dingemanse\n        \n              Website\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n      The Faculty of Biology is committed to actively support and foster good and open research practices including preregistration of studies, sharing of data and analysis scripts, and ensuring open access to publications wherever possible. As a funding institutional member, we aim to support training and community building activities that advance robust and reproducible research at LMU.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Faculty of Business Administration - Munich School of Management\n        Contact Person: \n        Prof. Dr. Ralf Elsas\n        \n              Website\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n       The LMU Munich School of Management is committed to advancing the principles of open science and research transparency. By becoming an institutional member of the LMU's Open Science Center, we aim to foster a culture of openness, collaboration, and integrity in our research community. We believe that promoting open access to data, methodologies, and findings will enhance the quality and reproducibility of research in business studies, ultimately contributing to innovative and impactful solutions for global business challenges."

In a nutshell, Quarto lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of executable code written in, e.g., R or Python. You can use it for interactive notebooks, and export to a large number of formats including HTML, PDF/LaTeX, Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or even interactive websites. In this workshop, we cover the fundamentals, including the markdown syntax, code chunks and inline code, and the output formats available. We also go over citations, cross-referencing, and templating, which ultimately allow you to write academic papers entirely in Quarto.\n\n\nThe self-paced tutorial for this workshop can be found here: https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-Quarto/\n\n\nThe self-paced tutorials focus on using Quarto with R and RStudio, which is also used by the instructors in their research and teaching. They are, however, no experts for every possible environment, but will try their best to assist you.\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are total novices or intermediate users of literate programming tools (e.g. Rmarkdown, Quarto), who program (at any level) in R, Python, or Julia, and preferentially use RStudio (although VS Code, Jupyter, Neovim or other text editor are also suitable). Ideally, participants already know of or use version control.\n\n\nRequirement: Participants must have their own laptop with admin access. Software will be installed as part of the workshop.\n\n\nInstructor: Dr Florian Pargent and Florian Kohrt\n\n\nThe event will be held in English."

Multiple defensible alternative options are available for selection throughout the study design, data preprocessing and data analysis workflow. In line with a traditional analysis approach, researchers will select one sole workflow of defensible options and often do not specifically disclose how the decisions were made. However, a multiple comparison problem occurs even if only one constructed dataset following one single workflow of decisions is used for statistical inferences. The reason is that theoretically a large variety of workflows is possible, but researchers do not correct their hypothesis tests for potential comparisons that they did not explicitly carry out.\n\n\nRecently, statistical approaches have been proposed to explore and integrate multiple inferential results accumulated along forking paths. Multiverse analysis (Steegen et al., 2016) refers to repeated hypothesis testing on the multitude of datasets resulting from different defensible decisions regarding, for example, variable selection, categorization, transformation, outlier selection, etc. After combining all potential choices by simple rules of combinatorics, contradictory combinations are eliminated. Datasets created on the basis of the remaining set of combinations are then submitted to statistical analyses along a looped pipeline. Results provide as many outcomes of statistical tests as datasets created in the multiverse. These can then be visualized to understand how statistical conclusions depend on methodological decisions or they can be statistically integrated.\n\n\nIn this workshop, unexperienced attendees who attended the lecture on the previous day will be guided through an implementation example of multiverse analyses on the R Software for Statistical Computing. There will be time for exercises and discussions. Workshop materials and necessary R packages will be shared in advance and participants are expected to join the workshop with their own laptops.\n\n\nInstructor: Andrea Hildebrandt, Professor for Psychological Methods and Statistics at the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Department of Psychology and Cassie Short, Postdoc at the Psychological Methods and Statistics Lab of the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Department of Psychology\n\n\nParticipants: Scientists from any discipline who apply statistical models in the framework of regression analysis, without prior experience with multiverse analysis implementations.\n\n\nPrerequisite: Basic statistics (including GLM) and statistical programming skills in R are required. R software must be installed prior to the workshop. Participants must also have attended the lecture on the previous day: https://www.pretix.osc.lmu.de/lmu-osc/multiverse-L/\n\n\nLogistics: The event will be held in person, in English. Participation in the workshop is free and open to all. Priority will be given to, in order, members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (Department of Psychology, Business Administration, Biology), other LMU members, and non-LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

Another important, but underrated, aspect is that researchers – even statisticians – tend to disregard important epistemic foundations of statistics. This lack of principle (or knowledge) effectively contributes to questionable research practices, statistical rituals, delusions and fallacies about what statistics and science can achieve. In the age of big data and foundation models, the importance of these topics is greater than ever before.\n\n\nWith keynotes by select speakers and ample time for discussion, we will address the question why the inappropriate use of statistical methods (most prominently, statistical testing) is still so prevalent, despite warnings that have been voiced for decades.\n\n\nKeynote talks:\n\n\n\nSabina Leonelli (TU Munich), was recently appointed Professor for Philosophy and History of Science and Technology at TUM. She works on the philosophy of data-intensive science; in particular, the impact of big and open data on research and society in general.\n\n\nUwe Saint-Mont (HS Nordhausen),  holds a chair at the Department of Economics and Social Sciences. He works on statistical theory, philosophy of statistics, and philosophy of science.\n\n\n\nOther talks:\n\n\n\nWalter Radermacher (Advisory Board on Ethics of the International Statistical Institute and LMU Munich), is a Professor of Statistics at LMU. Additionally, he serves as the Advisory Board Chair of the International Statistical Institute (ISI). Furthermore, he has experience in public administration at national and European levels, having served as President of the German Statistical Office (destatis), Director General of Eurostat and Chief Statistician of the European Union, and Chair of the destatis Commission Future Statistics. He works on statistics, sustainable development, governance, ethics, and data analysis.\n\n\nRudolf Seising (Deutsches Museum), currently chairs the BMBF research project “Eine Geschichte der KI in der BRD”. He works on the history of science and artificial intelligence.\n\n\nMichael Schomaker (LMU Munich), is a Professor for Biostatistics working under the German Research Foundation’s Heisenberg Program. He works on the appropriate use of modern causal inference methods.\n\n\n\nRegistration:\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation is open to everyone and free of charge. Seats will be given on a first-register, first-serve basis.\n\n\nTo join the discussion, please register at https://www.pretix.osc.lmu.de/lmu-osc/osis2024/ by October 31st.\n\n\nThe current program allows some room for further talks – please reach out to epix.workshop@stat.uni-muenchen.de if you would like to add your perspective to the workshop.\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing you at EPIX!\n\n\nContact:\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact epix.workshop@stat.uni-muenchen.de."

Accordingly, researchers should not only make research results freely available, for example in the form of scientific articles (open access), but also provide research data, analysis scripts and study materials. However, the reusability of the data made available requires comprehensive research data management (RDM) on the part of the researchers. In particular, research data should be made available in accordance with the FAIR principles, meaning that research data should be Findable, Accessible, and usable (Interoperable and Reusable). In this workshop, you will learn about FAIR data management in the social sciences. Specifically, you will 1) create a data management plan and 2) get an introduction to FAIR data documentation.\n\n\nTarget audience: PhD students and post-docs from the social sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc). However, interested students are also welcome.\n\n\nPrerequisites: There is no prior knowledge required on research data management or the implementation of the FAIR principles. To participate in the hands-on session on data management planning, please create an account for the DMPTool https://dmptool.org/ if you do not already have one.\n\n\nLogistics: This event will be held online. Priority will be given to LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the current Debates about Registered Reports. This week, we are very happy to host Gilad Feldman as our guest. He is an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong and conducts research in the field of social psychology and decision making. Additionally he has taken special interest in the movement for improvement of psychological science to implement and promote open-science and meta-research. Together with him we will discuss the format of Registered Reports and its prospects as well as limitations. You can find the recommended article and a short abstract about the topic of the session below.\n\n\nProcedure: Dr. Gilad Feldman will introduce (approx. 20 minutes) the article. We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nAbstract: The article discusses the value and impact of Registered Reports, a publication format that addresses reporting and publication biases by pre-accepting study proposals that went through rigorous peer review. It reflects on the history and progress of Registered Reports, provides practical guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, and presents early evidence of their effectiveness. While acknowledging their limitations, the article highlights the potential of Registered Reports to promote reproducibility, transparency, and self-correction in research.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFinia Loeb, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

The talk takes the field of psychology as a starting point, but also makes more general points about statistical practices, NHST, and academic incentive structures that apply to many scientific fields.\n\n\nAfter the talk, the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club team will be hosting an open discussion with the presenter from 16:00 to 17:00. Participants will be able to ask follow-up questions to the lecturer and discuss own ideas in a less formal and more open round. There will be no additional presentation on the topic, so it would be best to attend the lecture before (see above).\n\n\nBoth the lecture and the discussion will take place solely in person on this occasion.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIt is plausible that the widespread use of Questionable (or worse) Research Practices has substantially contributed to the current replication crisis in psychology. But would we still have a replication crisis if everyone had always played by the rules?We like to believe that we are aiming to be objective and self-critical, working towards a reliable body of knowledge about the mind/brain. Our methodological Superego is still guided by Popperian Falsificationism and Feynmanian “bending over backwards”. However, our methodological Id wants to publish as many influential papers as we can, with as few resources as possible. In this Freudian model, it is the job of the methodological Ego to negotiate between these two conflicting desires.Our current system of methodological conventions, rules, and practices, essentially a fusion of inverse Falsificationism and NHST, is very effective at keeping both Superego and Id happy: it gives the impression of being objective, self-critical, and scientific, while at the same time making it very easy, too easy, to reach evidence standards that allow us to publish our claims. This means that even if we all “played by the rules”, we would still not produce reliable knowledge.It is very difficult to change this situation, because the current incentive structures in scientific psychology strongly reward the publication of attractive findings, while there are hardly (if any) negative consequences for publishing false claims. Nevertheless, I will optimistically suggest a number of potential improvements."

Für manche ist Publizieren zu einer finanziellen Herausforderung geworden. An vielen Fakultäten wird daher intensiv über den Umgang mit diesen Kosten und über das kommerzielle Publikationssystem im Allgemeinen diskutiert. Das LMU Open Science Center möchte mit dieser Veranstaltung eine Plattform bieten, um drei Aspekte zu beleuchten und zu diskutieren:\n\n\nTeil I (16:00–17:00; hybrid) – Nachgefragt: Status Quo von DEAL & Co. und Handhabung der Publikationskosten an der LMUVeronika Reinertshofer von der Universitätsbibliothek erläutert den aktuellen Stand der DEAL-Verträge, räumt typische Missverständnisse aus und beantwortet Ihre Fragen. Außerdem zeigen wir praxisorientiert auf, wie Sie im bestehenden System möglichst offen publizieren – von den OA-Fördermitteln der LMU bis zu „Green Open Access“.\n\n\nTeil II (17:00–18:00; hybrid) – Weitergedacht: Modelle jenseits von DEAL und die Rückgewinnung wissenschaftlicher AutonomieWir zeigen Best-Practice-Beispiele wie gemeinwohlorientierte Infrastrukturen aufgebaut werden können und beleuchten internationale Trends, welche Rolle Fachcommunities und Hochschulen beim Publizieren ohne kommerzielle Verlage spielen könnten. Prof. Markus Gebhardt (LMU) berichtet von der Gründung eines Diamond-OA-Journals an der LMU, Prof. Felix Schönbrodt (LMU) wird die “Peer Community In (PCI)” Plattform vorstellen, welche bereits in vielen Disziplinen eine Qualitätssicherung durch Peer Review nicht-kommerziell organisiert. Prof. Björn Brembs (Universität Regensburg) diskutiert, wie traditionelle Journals gänzlich durch dezentrale und resiliente Infrastrukturen ersetzt werden können, die durch Interoperabilität und offene Standards vernetzt sind.\n\n\nOptionaler Teil III (18:00–19:00; nur vor Ort) – Vernetzt vor Ort: Konkrete Schritte für die LMUVertreterinnen und Vertreter verschiedener Fakultäten tauschen sich über die jeweilige Betroffenheit der einzelnen Disziplinen aus und erörtern etwaige Überlegungen / Strategien auf Instituts-/Fakultätsebene. Sie diskutieren in dem Rundgespräch Handlungsspielräume im aktuellen System, Wünsche an zukünftige Verhandlungsrunden sowie Strategien, um statt symptomorientierter Maßnahmen nachhaltige Systemveränderungen anzustoßen.\n\n\nDa die Platzzahl vor Ort limitiert ist, ist eine vorherige Anmeldung notwendig, insbesondere für Personen, die auch an Teil III teilnehmen wollen. Eine Teilnahme an Teil I und II ist online ohne Platzbeschränkung möglich."

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the importance of good quality working conditions for high quality reserach. There will be a short introduction into a paper by Rahul’s et al. that discusses ways to redesign academic systems, emphasizing the role of permanent employment. Then there will be room for a discussion.\n\n\nProcedure: One member of our organising team will introduce (approx. 20 minutes). We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

In this flipped classroom workshop, we will help you solve the individual problems you have encountered when writing your own manuscript with Quarto.\n\n\nQuarto (the successor of R Markdown) is a popular open-source software for writing reproducible scientific manuscripts. It can also produce websites, blogs, books, presentations, dashboards and much more. Quarto can be used together with R, Python or Julia. If you want to learn how to use Quarto and write reproducible scientific manuscripts with R, we have prepared a self-paced online tutorial for you.\n\n\nBefore the workshop:\n\n\nIt is intended that you familiarize yourself with how Quarto works and have started your own reproducible manuscript before attending the workshop. If you have never worked with Quarto, R Markdown, or Jupyter Notebooks before, you should plan at least one workday for preparation. The following sections of the self-paced online tutorial are particularly relevant for you to be able to create a reproducible scientific manuscript:\n\n\n\nQuarto Tutorials: Companion to the beginner tutorials on the official Quarto website.\n\n\nExercise: APA 7 Manuscripts: An introduction to the Quarto extension apaquarto , which allows formatting Quarto documents as APA 7 manuscripts.\n\n\nOptional: Exercise: Quarto Manuscripts: Quarto Manuscripts enable you to create a website that showcases your manuscript and provides a bundle with all the code and materials necessary to reproduce your manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the workshop:\n\n\nThere will only be minimal input from our side during the workshop, as you have already familiarized yourself with Quarto beforehand so we can focus on your individual problems. After a brief welcome, we will collect the types of problems you encountered when trying to write your own manuscript and divide you into groups, so you can start helping each other. We will try to answer your individual questions and assist with the problems you encountered. When your problem is solved, you can continue working on your own manuscript during the workshop. We will wrap up with a short summary on commonly encountered challenges.\n\n\n \n\n\nTarget audience: Scientists and students who want to write a reproducible manuscript with Quarto and have started their first reproducible manuscript. If you have some experience with Quarto yourself and want to assist you colleagues during the workshop, you are very welcome as well!\n\n\nPrerequisites: Participants have worked through a Quarto tutorial before the workshop, have started to write their own manuscript in Quarto and have encountered questions or unsolved problems.\n\n\nMax. number of participants: Until the room is full"

In our new panel discussion series, we try to make this tacit knowledge open by asking the relevant questions to a diverse set of experts.\n\n\nHELLO WORLD: ACADEMIA ABROADMore than any other field of work, academia is a global industry. We collaborate in international teams, have colleagues who worked abroad, and are expected to gain international experience for career progression. But what is it like to work in other countries? How do their systems, their incentive structures, and research environments differ from German academia? This will be the topic of our second panel discussion with a range of psychology researchers who have experience working in Germany and abroad.\n\n\nPanel Members:\n\n\n\nProf. Dr. Christopher Donkin (Computational Modeling in Psychology, LMU)\n\n\nDr. Nathan Evans (Computational Modeling in Psychology, LMU)\n\n\nProf. Dr. Friederike Funk (Social Psychology, LMU)\n\n\nProf. Dr. David Goretzko (Methodology & Statistics, Utrecht University)\n\n\nDr. Malika Ihle (LMU Open Science Center)\n\n\nProf. Dr. Clemens Stachl (Behavioral Science and Technology, University of St. Gallen)\n\n\n\nTarget audience: Anyone curious about how academia works outside of Germany\n\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\n\nMax. number of participants: No maximum"

What are barriers towards Open Science at the university, and how can we overcome them? What can you as an individual researcher or student, do to foster Open Science practices? During the workshop we will do several interactive exercises to think about out-of-the-box solutions to democratize Open Science. We will focus on exploring ideas, identifying barriers and how to overcome them to strengthen Open Science for individual researchers and in a team setting.\n\n\nTarget audience: The workshop is open to all levels of career stages: students, PhD candidates, post-docs, lecturers and professors.\n\n\nLogistics: Due to the interactive nature of the workshop it will be held in-person\n\n\nInstructor: Iris Lechner is PhD candidate at the philosophy department of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Her thesis focuses on the question ‘what is a good university?’. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts and sciences she studied health sciences and bioethics. Recently, her interests have geared to social epistemology, philosophy of higher education, research integrity and the application of qualitative research methods in these fields."

Upholding the highest quality standards in scholarly communication is thus of vital importance for scholarship as well as for safeguarding the integrity of the scholarly commons and the scholarly ecosystem. Predatory publishing has gained much prominence in recent years as one new persistent phenomenon that undermines the foundation of scholarly publishing and its principles and standards. On the 10th of May you are invited to a lively discussion and exchange on this matter. Veronika Reinertshofer (UB LMU) Susanne Luger (JKU Linz, Project ‘Predatory Publishing’, Austrians Transition to Open Access 2) and Clara Ginther (University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Project ‘Predatory Publishing’, Austrians Transition to Open Access 2) will provide short inputs on quality and scholarly publishing as well as predatory publishing. This is interlaced with opportunities for discussion and exploration. The aim is to initiate an ongoing dialogue on how to address these questionable practices which are ever-evolving and changing.\n\n\nInstructors:\n\n\n\nSusanne Luger is head of the department License Management and Scholarly Services at University Library of the Johannes Kepler University Linz.\n\n\nClara Ginter is Head of the University Library at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. They co-lead the project ‘Predatory Publishing’, part of Austrian Transition to Open Access 2 (AT2OA2).\n\n\nVeronika Reinertshofer is employee of the University Library of LMU Munich and works in the associated electronic publishing divisions: publishing services open access.\n\n\n\nTarget audience: This online workshop is open to all LMU employees and students, including people who are not in the OSIM mailing list. You are welcome to join!\n\n\nLogistics: The online OSIM-meeting will this time take the form of a small workshop with discussion led by our three guests, including two co-leaders of the project ‘Predatory Publishing’, part of Austrian Transition to Open Access 2."

It will take place next Friday and consist of an introductory session to Open Science. Its purpose is to introduce new people to Open Science and our journal club, but also give an overview about the topic for those who are already familiar with it.\n\n\nPaper: This time we did not select any specific paper. So just join and enjoy the session :-)\n\n\nProcedure: Two members of our organising team will give an introductory talk on Open Science and the replication crisis (approx. 30 minutes). We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nBelow, you can find a short abstract for the session and its introductory presentation by two members of your organisation team, Gracia Prüm and Laura Goetz (LMU Munich).\n\n\nWelcome to the Open Science Universe\n\n\nYou have never heard of Open Science before? In our presentation “Welcome to the Open Science Universe” we are going to give an introduction to Open Science as well as the most important terms and topics linked to it. Have you ever wondered what goes wrong in science and why, and what you can do about it? Then you have come to the right place! Just a little spoiler: the goal of Open Science is to make science reproducible, open and accessible for everybody. Of course, we are also happy if people join us who are already experts in the field of Open Science, which will only make the discussion more interesting.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

I will briefly talk about the advantages of formal models over narrative ones, and present a few examples from my own lab in which such a formalization was attempted more or less successfully. However, the largest part of the workshop shall be reserved for participants working on formal versions of narrative theory paragraphs that they themselves pick and bring along. As this is likely to be a relatively new kind of challenge to most participants, and given that formalization can actually be fairly difficult, the overall objective is not to achieve perfect results, but rather to get people interested in this crucial type of work, and to help them overcome initial hesitations they may have to invest their valuable time and energy into it.\n\n\nTarget audience: scientists of all career levels (students to PIs) from the fields of psychology, philosophy, sociology, etc.\n\n\nAgenda: 60 m Intro ; 15 m Break ; 75 m First Round Practice ; 15 m Break ; 75 m Second Round Practice\n\n\nLogistics: There are no prerequisites. The format of the session is hybrid (you can attend online or in person). The event will be held in English, unless there are only German native speakers in the room. Participation in the workshop is free and open to all. Priority will be given to, in order, members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (Department of Psychology, Business Administration, Biology), other LMU members, and non-LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop."

Julia’s user-friendly interface, resembling popular languages like R, Python, and Matlab, makes it easily accessible for learners. Its focus on performance, however, enables computational speeds that often rival, or even surpass, those of low-level languages such as C or Fortran. Therefore, Julia is an ideal choice for large-scale data analysis and other computationally intensive tasks, as it can be orders of magnitude faster than R or Python.\n\n\nIn this workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of Julia and the key features setting it apart from other languages.\n\n\nParticipants: This workshop is designed for R users who are interested in learning a new programming language or want to improve their skills in data analysis and scientific computing. No prior experience with Julia is required, but a understanding of R is recommended.\n\n\nInstructors: A team from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, the Max Planck School of Cognition, and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research will instruct this workshop: Dr. Aaron Peikert, post-doctoral fellow, Maximilian Ernst, PhD student, and Moritz Ketzer, PhD student."

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the Theoretical Frameworks. Following a quick introduction into Muthukrishna et. al. paper “A problem in theory”, that stresses the importance of cumulative theoretical framework in order to mitigate the replication crisis and to pave the way toward a more general theory of human behaviour, we would like to discuss whether these frameworks could actually be Lifesavers for Psychology.\n\n\nProcedure: One member of our organising team will introduce (approx. 20 minutes) the paper. We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFinia Loeb, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

In our new panel discussion series, we try to make this tacit knowledge open by asking the relevant questions to a diverse set of experts.\n\n\nPRACTICES AND PRACTICALITIES OF PEER REVIEWMost researchers spend a significant amount of time and effort on peer reviewing. However, there is large variability in peer reviewing practices and little guidance for early career researchers on the topic. For this panel discussion, we assemble experts from different fields of psychology to talk about their experiences with peer review from a reviewer’s and/or editor’s perspective. We talk about how they developed their own style of peer reviewing, what they consider a good peer review, tips and tricks for peer-reviewing efficiently, and how their personal scientific philosophy influences their peer reviews.\n\n\nPanel Members: \n\n\n\nDr. Marlene Altenmüller (Social Psychology)\n\n\nDr. Peter Edelsbrunner (Learning Sciences, ETH Zürich)\n\n\nDr. Nathan Evans (Computational Modeling in Psychology)\n\n\nDr. Florian Pargent (Psychological Methods and Assessment)\n\n\nProf. Dr. Tobias Staudigl (Cognitive Neuropsychology)\n\n\nDr. Charlotte Wittekind (Clinical Psychology)\n\n\n\nTarget audience: Anyone curious about how other people write peer reviews\n\n\nPrerequisites: None (no peer reviewing experience required)\n\n\nMax. number of participants: No maximum"

One way to deal with this methodological flexibility are sensitivity analyses. In this short workshop, we will discuss when sensitivity analyses can be useful, what they can look like in practice, and how they can be embedded in scientific publications.\n\n\nRegistered Reports (http://cos.io/rr) are a publication process now adopted by over 300 journals in psychological science and beyond, in which Stage 1 journal peer review occurs on a pre-registration plan prior to any data collection. Once the pre¬registration passes peer review and is approved, the journal grants authors an in-principle acceptance guaranteeing the publication of the article provided that data collection and analysis follows and intended plan. This emphasizes design, methods, and rigor, addressing issues of reviewers’ and publication bias with publication of findings regardless of data collection outcomes, with the Stage 2 peer review focused solely on ensuring adherence to the Stage 1 plan (or documenting deviations).\n\n\n‎“Peer Community in Registered Report”‎ (PCI-RR; https://rr.peercommunityin.org/) is a new initiative launched in 2021 that builds on Registered Reports and is aimed at improving further on Registered Reports. It provides community open identified peer-review on posted Registered Report Stage 1 preprints, led by open-science trained recommenders (editors), with in-principle acceptance from the community endorsed for publication by a variety of open-science supportive journals. This initiative also includes an option for a “scheduled review” path which allows timely community expert open-science supportive peer review within two weeks, short enough to fit into an academic year thesis schedule. PCIRR is nothing short of a revolution in science.\n\n\nWith guided thesis students and an early-career researcher team building on work by undergraduate students in my courses, in the last two years we submitted over 20 PCIRR manuscripts, with some already published, and most already granted an in-principle acceptance. Overall, it has been a very positive and rewarding experience for the students and the team. This is part of a large-scale replications project of over 100 classic studies in judgment and decision-making and social psychology. Information on this project and how to join us can be found on: https://mgto.org/core-team/\n\n\nIn this workshop I will share my experience with Registered Reports, PCIRR, and working on Registered Reports with students and early-career researchers. I will go over relevant templates and guides from our many open collaborative resources (https://mgto.org/resources/), going over best practices and examples of Registered Reports. Finally, and most importantly, we’ll aim to write a simple Replication Registered Report together, hands-on, to demonstrate the process – step by step.\n\n\nParticipants: The targeted audience are scientists of all career levels (from MSc) from any confirmatory quantitative research\n\n\nRequirement: Participants should bring their own laptop.\n\n\nInstructor: Dr. Gilad Feldman (Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong)\n\n\nThe event will be held in English."

One way to deal with this methodological flexibility are sensitivity analyses. In this short workshop, we will discuss when sensitivity analyses can be useful, what they can look like in practice, and how they can be embedded in scientific publications.\n\n\nParticipation in the workshop is free and open to all. Priority will be given to, in order, members of Departments sponsoring the Open Science Center (Department of Psychology, Business Administration, Biology), other LMU members, and non-LMU members. Non-members will receive confirmation whether their attendance is possible at least 2 days before the workshop.\n\n\nInstructor: Dr Angelika Stefan (Chair of Computational Modeling in Psychology, LMU)\n\n\nThe event will be held in English, unless there are only German native speakers in the room!"

It will take place this Friday and we will talk about the The Generalizability Crisis. During this sessions we will discuss Tal Yarkoni’s paper „The generalizability crisis“ that deals with the consequences arising when verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis do not closely align, potentially resulting in inflated false-positive rates and mitigating validity and researchers’ generalization intentions.\n\n\nProcedure: One member of our organising team will introduce (approx. 20 minutes). We will then continue with an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.\n\n\nConcept of the Journal Club\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary journal club “ReproducibiliTea” is launched every 3-4 weeks and addresses main questions and current topics concerning Open Science and the credibility of research findings. The idea - originated from Great Britain - was already developed in many other countries using the same name. During on-site meetings tea, juice and small snacks are provided to live up to the slogan. However, some meetings are held online due to organisational reasons. No matter where the sessions take place, everybody is welcome to bring their own food and drinks and thus connect the journal club with their lunch break.\n\n\nThe Journal Club consists of open talk sessions for discussing Open Science, reproducibility, and other related issues and is explicitly open to all disciplines and institutions to create the most interesting interchange. Each session starts with a short talk about the paper and then continues with an open discussion in which you can contribute your own thoughts and questions.\n\n\nDuring a longer break between 2020 and 2021, the concept was slightly revised, and the organisation team decided to invite the speaker(s) of the respective paper that is discussed in each session. The author herself/himself starts with the introductory talk including a short summary of the paper. Afterwards, there is enough time for direct interaction with the author(s) and, as before, an open discussion with all of the participants.\n\n\nYou are warmly welcome to join the next meetings. You can simply send an e-mail to reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com to join the mailing list to get information about the next meetings and chosen papers. For each session it would be helpful to have read the announced paper, but there is no obligation to do so.\n\n\nThe organisation team is looking forward to seeing you at one of the next Journal Club sessions.\n\n\nOrganisation team:\n\n\n\nLaura Goetz, Medical Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nStephan Nuding, PhD Student at the Chair of Social Psychology\n\n\nLeonhard Schramm, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFranka Etzel, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nViktoria Wiegelmann, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nGracia Pruem, Psychology Student at LMU Munich\n\n\nFinia Loeb, Psychology Student at LMU Munich"

By integrating Plotly’s capabilities into your research dissemination practices, you can enhance the accessibility and impact of your findings.\n\n\nTarget audience: This session is designed for researchers across all disciplines who are interested in learning new advanced visualization techniques. If you’ve ever been frustrated that a graphic couldn’t communicate what you wanted it to, this workshop is for you. The workshop will be conducted in R, other programming languages are welcomed as Plotly can also be used in a Python environment but not covered by the workshop itself.\n\n\nPrerequisites: Basic R programming skills"
