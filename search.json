I think archaeology is uniquely positioned at the intersection of science and humanities, and in some ways, enables us to unite the capabilities of both spheres of scientific inquiry. The process by which we collect and process data and thereby produce a narrative of the past parallels the way the past is revealed to us by the creators of the objects and their narratives. Thus, how we apply open science in today’s world not only has a direct bearing on data integrity and transparency, but also shapes the development of equitable narratives in science and society at large (where we combat rampant misinformation and confirmation biases). There is considerable distance between the way Open Science reforms are being expedited in the natural and social sciences today and how humanities are leveraging these practices to gain fresh perspectives that authentically showcase the human experience. I am interested in how we close that gap."

I make my own research, including materials, data, and analysis scripts, publicly available. I also promote Open Science in talks at workshops and seminars. Since April 2018, I organise a monthly event called Open Science Beers, which aims to bring together scientists across fields for informal conversations about Open Science."

Even before I started studying psychology, I had a lot of questions related to good scientific practice, and few weeks into my first psychology semester at the LMU, I learned about the Open Science movement (thanks to the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club!). I think it is very valuable to learn more about Open Science, to talk about it with others, to come up with new questions and to try to find answers together. This is why I joined the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club. I am now part of the organisation team of this Journal Club as I think it is one of the best places to start raising awareness about Open Science and spreading good scientific practice among students, since mostly bachelor's and master's students attend our meetings. On a related note, I am also interested in science communication and how we can make scientific knowledge accesible to everyone."

You are invited to apply for one or both tracks. For either track, you can choose to participate either online or in-person.\nTrack 1: Open Science knowledge and skills\nIn this track, early career researchers who are Open Science novices learn to make their research more transparent, reproducible and credible in the eyes of their peers, the public, and funding agencies. This track consists of public lectures accessible to anyone as well as hands-on practical workshops for selected applicants and extends from Monday 15.09.2025 9:00 to Friday 19.09.2025 14:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nSpecify research design and set up statistical plans in advance of collecting data to prevent biases in analyses, with the help of preregistration and data simulation.\nCreate computationally reproducible workflows to be more efficient and spot mistakes in data wrangling or analyses, through programming with version controlled scripts.\nPrepare and share data and code in connection with manuscripts by applying the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles, and using adequate repositories and licenses to accumulate credit and citations.\n\nTrack 2: Open Science instructor training\nIn this track, early career researchers or research support staff interested in becoming Open Science instructors develop essential pedagogical skills to promote Open Science through teaching - no prior experience in teaching required. This track extends from Friday 19.09.2025 14:30 to 17:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nDesign and deliver Open Science workshops, and apply basic didactic techniques to diverse audiences.\nApply activation methods in the classroom to foster motivation and attention.\nDevelop skills to advocate for Open Science, to lead research groups and discussions around Open Science, and to analyse the potential challenges and issues around the implementation of Open Science practices.\n\nAfter joining this track, you will have the opportunity to put your new skills into practice and co-deliver a workshop at LMU to become a certified Open Science instructor.\n\n\nKeynote presenters\n\n\nLaura Meier\nMaximilian Frank\nFlorian Kohrt\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\nWe are looking forward to your participation!

Many details can be hidden under the carpet, both from the observational and numerical side. In my work I am trying to explain all the assumptions made during my work, and I am planning to render more public all the codes and data used during the simulations and in the post-processing phase."

I am convinced that this is best achieved by Open Science. This requires that the FAIR principles are not only applied to data, but also the to the whole infrastructure required for the analysis of the data, including in particular the software. I have led a task force to established an Open Source Software Policy at the international Belle II collaboration and taken care of the publication of its main software. I am also working on technologies that facilitate the reuse and reinterpretation of data."

Back the time of my psychology studies, I was lucky to be assigned to emprical course (EmPra) in which we conducted a replication of an existing study. This was my first point of contact with the topic replication crisis and the many proposals for reforming science that can be summarized under the term \"Open Science\". Since then, the topic has stuck with me and I have consequently become involved in several Open Science initiatives. Personally, in addition to a transparent and reproducible work process in my own research, I am engaged in teaching Open Science practices to students and early career researchers. They are the scientists of the future, which is why we owe them a state-of-the-art education which covers these important topics to benefit science as a whole."

We employ advanced statistics, machine learning and computer vision techniques in the context of clinical radiology to enable fast and precise AI-supported diagnosis and prognostication. Open science and reproducible research in this field is highly relevant, especially with deep learning or machine learning.

He uses this to describe how we all have made mistakes in statistics. In Open Science is exactly the same. The question is what do we do about it. Do we live further in sin or we try for redemption? I am trying to get out of the cycle taught to me. Open Science is unusual but challenging at the same time. We get to see what we should keep and what we should change from the old science way. For what I have seen, the change is difficult but the tools are there. We just need to learn them and make them public and accessible for the community. That is what I am trying to do every day with my students, my colleagues and all who want to listen. All what I am learning I am making it public in YouTube, so that others have an easier transition. My area of research is infection biology. We really need Open Science and FAIR data principles to understand the real relationship of microorganism with humans and environment."

My main engagement with Open Science is in the sharing and development of best practice for assessing and improving data quality in online questionnaires and experiments. In order to make transparent decisions about how (or whether) to filter poor-quality responses, and to evaluate how these decisions might impact conclusions, we need open survey materials, transparent reporting of data-quality indexes, reproducible data-processing scripts and detailed quality-assessment scripts."

To empower enthusiastic users, I always follow open science principles and make the projects fully open to the research community. My ultimate goal is to introduce more deductive thinking to the clinical practice in dentistry. Inspired by the AI Safety Fundamentals program held by Effective Altruism Germany, I am also concerned about how AI impacts the current practice of academia. Open science could play a pivotal role in mitigating the potential harm."

Although initially perceived as potentially demanding extra effort, tools such as R and R Markdown can in fact streamline our work and are surprisingly easy to learn.Thus I find it important that promoting Open Science includes highlighting these practical advantages of technical solutions for researchers' lives. This is why I am involved in the RPsyche course, which strives to teach fellow students how R can be used for research so that both themselves and others benefit from it."

Finally, we apply artificial intelligence in a trustworthy manner to problems from medical imaging, robotics, and telecommunication.\n\nResearch in the area of artificial Intelligence requires extensive amounts of data.
