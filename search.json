Although initially perceived as potentially demanding extra effort, tools such as R and R Markdown can in fact streamline our work and are surprisingly easy to learn.Thus I find it important that promoting Open Science includes highlighting these practical advantages of technical solutions for researchers' lives. This is why I am involved in the RPsyche course, which strives to teach fellow students how R can be used for research so that both themselves and others benefit from it."

Even before I started studying psychology, I had a lot of questions related to good scientific practice, and few weeks into my first psychology semester at the LMU, I learned about the Open Science movement (thanks to the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club!). I think it is very valuable to learn more about Open Science, to talk about it with others, to come up with new questions and to try to find answers together. This is why I joined the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club. I am now part of the organisation team of this Journal Club as I think it is one of the best places to start raising awareness about Open Science and spreading good scientific practice among students, since mostly bachelor's and master's students attend our meetings. On a related note, I am also interested in science communication and how we can make scientific knowledge accesible to everyone."

Back the time of my psychology studies, I was lucky to be assigned to emprical course (EmPra) in which we conducted a replication of an existing study. This was my first point of contact with the topic replication crisis and the many proposals for reforming science that can be summarized under the term \"Open Science\". Since then, the topic has stuck with me and I have consequently become involved in several Open Science initiatives. Personally, in addition to a transparent and reproducible work process in my own research, I am engaged in teaching Open Science practices to students and early career researchers. They are the scientists of the future, which is why we owe them a state-of-the-art education which covers these important topics to benefit science as a whole."

You are invited to apply for one or both tracks. For either track, you can choose to participate either online or in-person.\nTrack 1: Open Science knowledge and skills\nIn this track, early career researchers who are Open Science novices learn to make their research more transparent, reproducible and credible in the eyes of their peers, the public, and funding agencies. This track consists of public lectures accessible to anyone as well as hands-on practical workshops for selected applicants and extends from Monday 15.09.2025 9:00 to Friday 19.09.2025 14:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nSpecify research design and set up statistical plans in advance of collecting data to prevent biases in analyses, with the help of preregistration and data simulation.\nCreate computationally reproducible workflows to be more efficient and spot mistakes in data wrangling or analyses, through programming with version controlled scripts.\nPrepare and share data and code in connection with manuscripts by applying the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles, and using adequate repositories and licenses to accumulate credit and citations.\n\nTrack 2: Open Science instructor training\nIn this track, early career researchers or research support staff interested in becoming Open Science instructors develop essential pedagogical skills to promote Open Science through teaching - no prior experience in teaching required. This track extends from Friday 19.09.2025 14:30 to 17:30.\nParticipants of this track learn how to:\n\nDesign and deliver Open Science workshops, and apply basic didactic techniques to diverse audiences.\nApply activation methods in the classroom to foster motivation and attention.\nDevelop skills to advocate for Open Science, to lead research groups and discussions around Open Science, and to analyse the potential challenges and issues around the implementation of Open Science practices.\n\nAfter joining this track, you will have the opportunity to put your new skills into practice and co-deliver a workshop at LMU to become a certified Open Science instructor.\n\n\nKeynote presenters\n\n\nLaura Meier\nMaximilian Frank\nFlorian Kohrt\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\nWe are looking forward to your participation!

I am also an active member of the COVID-19 Data Analysis Group (CODAG) at the LMU.\n\nI believe that making science more transparent and open to the public is of paramount importance to maintain its credibility and increase its weight in public decision making. For this reason, I think science should invest more in effective communication. I am also an advocate for more data literacy within the general population, which I think will be needed to effectively challenge present and future societal challenges."

Especially through my job as a student assistant at the Chair of Psychological Methods and Diagnostics I learned more about Open Science and good scientific practice not only in theory. It started becoming more and more important to me so that I recently joined the organisational team of the Journal Club \"ReproducibiliTea\". To me it´s very important to further deepen my knowledge about Open Science and good scientific practices so I can spread the ideas and discuss different aspects of Open Science with others."

My interests lie particularly in improving scientific reproducibility by teaching software development practices, and in creating data analysis tools which can be used to assess replicability of research findings. I believe treating scientific analyses as if they were software development projects helps facilitate standard, understandable frameworks which can play a large role in addressing issues of reproducibility and replicability of research findings."
