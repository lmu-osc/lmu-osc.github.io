I am principal investigator for Psychological Methods and Assessment at the Department of Psychology. The reproducibility of research findings is a core criterion of science, which however, has been challenged by the failure of recent large-scale replication projects.\n\nTogether with the board of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) I developed the society's recommendations for data sharing in psychology.\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nOpen Science\nPsychology\nPsychological Methods\nData Sharing\n\nSelected Publications\n\n\n2024\n\n\"Machine Learning Applications in Organizational Behavior\"\nSmith, J., Johnson, A., & Williams, R.\n\nJournal of Applied Research, 42(3), 256-278\n\n\n\n\n DOI\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\"Open Methods in Psychology\"\nSchönbrodt, F.\n\nPsychological Methods, 15(2), 112-143\n\n\n\n\n DOI"
