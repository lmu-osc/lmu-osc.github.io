# Why Can't I See My New Push?

## Quick Answer

**No, your previous push from a different branch 20 minutes ago does not prevent you from seeing your new push.** Each branch is independent.

The most likely reason you can't see your changes is that **this repository has branch protection rules** that prevent direct pushes to the `main` branch.

## What's Probably Happening

1. **Branch Protection**: You cannot push directly to `main` - you'll get an error like:
   ```
   ! [remote rejected] main -> main (protected branch hook declined)
   ```

2. **Feature Branch Push**: If you pushed to a feature branch (any branch other than `main`), your changes won't appear on the live website until they're merged into `main`.

3. **Pull Request Required**: All changes must go through a pull request to be merged into `main`.

## Check Your Status

Run this command to see what happened:
```bash
./check-deployment-status.sh
```

Or manually check:
```bash
git branch                    # Which branch are you on?
git status                    # Any uncommitted changes?
git log main..your-branch     # What commits are unique to your branch?
```

## How to See Your Changes

### If you're on a feature branch:
1. Push your branch: `git push`
2. Go to GitHub and open a pull request
3. After the PR is merged, wait 5-10 minutes
4. Your changes will appear on https://lmu-osc.github.io/

### If you tried to push to main:
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
2. Push the branch: `git push -u origin feature/your-change`
3. Open a pull request on GitHub
4. After merge, wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

## Why This System Exists

- **Quality Control**: All changes are reviewed before going live
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously
- **Automated Deployment**: When changes are merged to `main`, the website rebuilds automatically
- **Backup**: Feature branches preserve your work even if something goes wrong

## The Bottom Line

Your previous push from another branch **does not interfere** with new pushes. The issue is that this repository requires all changes to go through pull requests for quality control and automated deployment.

**Next step**: Open a pull request to merge your changes into `main`, then they'll be live in 5-10 minutes!
