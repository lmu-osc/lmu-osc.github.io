<p>We compiled an <strong>impact report from 2017-2023</strong> which we are excited to share with you here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10285395">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10285395</a></p>
<p>It describes all our <strong>activities</strong> (training, community building, meta-research, consultations, and liaison with stakeholders), our <strong>incomes</strong> <strong>and expenditures</strong>, and our <strong>future strategies</strong>. We believe this report attests of the Center's success!</p>
<p>Below are some statistics on training offers since May 2022 when the coordinator role started, as well as on community building and meta- research activities since the OSC’s foundation in 2017.</p>
