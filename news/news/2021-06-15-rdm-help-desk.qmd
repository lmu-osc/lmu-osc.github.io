<p>The <a href="https://www.en.ub.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" title="University Library">LMU University Library</a> is an Institutional Member of the Open Science Center and encourages Open Access and Open Science. To support scholars and students of all LMU faculties with their RDM, the Universtiy Library has established the <a href="https://www.en.ub.uni-muenchen.de/writing/research_data/index.html" title="Research data">RDM Help Desk</a> (“FDM-Beratungsstelle").</p>
<p>The RDM Helpdesk provides general support covering various RDM topics. This implies services such as information and workshops regarding basic RDM requirements, directing to discipline-specific resources, support on designing RDM workflows or advice on data publication and storage options. Furthermore, the RDM Help Desk supports the planning of data management plans (DMPs) and helps you to get started with <a href="https://rdmo.ub.uni-muenchen.de/">RDMO </a>(Research Data Management Organizer), a web-based tool co-funded by the DFG for creating data management plans that runs on servers of the university library.</p>
