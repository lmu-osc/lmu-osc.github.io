How do I find Open Access journals? Where do I find practical resources on specific Open Science practices? Where do I find workshop material for teaching Open Science?</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p>In order to close the intention-action gap concerning Open Science practices, we created a collection of resources and tools that can be implemented in a transparent and reproducible research process. As a researcher you can look for resources for every stage of the research process. If you want to teach Open Science or participate in a course yourself, you'll find examplary workshop material, too.</p>
<p>Take a look at our new <a href="../../toolbox/index.html" title="Toolbox"><strong>Open Science Toolbox</strong></a> and don't hesitate to give feedback and suggestions.</p>
