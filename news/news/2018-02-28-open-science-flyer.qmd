<p>Doing transparent and reproducible research might look complicated at first sight. This info flyer outlines in 7 really easy steps how you can increase the openness of your research workflow.</p>
<p>There's an <a href="https://osf.io/hktmf/">English</a> and a <a href="https://osf.io/7au4n/">German</a> version of the flyer. The flyer has a CC-BY license; that means you can copy it, print it (we printed it on a 15x15cm card) and distribute it at your university, or take the information and remix it, as long as you credit the original authors.</p>
<p><em>This flyer has been created in a cooperation between the <a href="https://osf.io/tbkzh/">Network of Open Science Initiatives</a> and the LMU Open Science Center.</em></p>
