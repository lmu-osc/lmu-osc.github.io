<p>The <strong>Open Science Center (OSC)</strong> of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) is excited to introduce the <strong>Train-the-Trainer program</strong>, <a href=""https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/bringing-transparency-to-research-practice.html"" target=""_blank"">funded by the VW Foundation</a>. This initiative aims to <strong>promote open and reproducible research across academic disciplines</strong>. It equips researchers not only with hands-on Open Science skills for themselves, but also with the tools and knowledge to <strong>train other students and researchers in open research practices</strong> within their own fields.</p>
<p><strong>The OSC staff on the Train-the-Trainer program are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarah von Grebmer</strong> is the Train-the-Trainer Program Coordinator. She coordinates, develops and delivers the “Train-the-trainer” program to future Open Science trainers, and facilitates interdisciplinary workshops, seminars, and networking events to engage and support participants in adopting open research practices.</p>
<p><strong>Sara Lil Middleton</strong> is the Training Development Coordinator and Community Engagement Manager. She develops training content and manages and integrates contributions from the FORRT community. She will also co-develop auxiliary content to facilitate the longer-term engagement of Open Science practices beyond the completion of training courses.</p>
<p><strong>Reema Gupta</strong> is the OSC's FAIR data sharing expert. She specializes in data management, research data standards, and reproducible workflows. She creates training materials and provides consultations to researchers on these topics.</p>
<p>A key strength of the program lies in its close partnership with the<strong> Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training</strong> (<a href=""http://forrt.org"">FORRT</a>) community. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to systemic reform in research culture through education, grassroots collaboration, and equitable infrastructure. The FORRT project is an <strong>international</strong> and <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> <strong>community project</strong> that promotes and curates<strong> Open Science training resources and meta-research</strong>, and is committed to democratizing access to both learning and teaching materials in Open Science, ensuring equitable participation across career stages, disciplines, and geographies. For this partnership with the LMU OSC, FORRT contributes with expertise in Open Science pedagogy, inclusive education, participatory infrastructure-building, and metascience. Moreover, FORRT ensures that the Train-the-Trainer program also embeds diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) throughout. Its community developed resources, including training modules, lesson plans, and glossaries are integrated throughout to help ensure alignment with global Open Science values.</p>
<p>Over a three-year period, the program aims to train around 50 instructors, who will then go on to train students and researchers within their respective disciplines. The <strong>curriculum</strong> includes topics such as <strong>methodological foundations of Open Science, computational reproducibility, tools for collaborative working, data management and data sharing</strong>. In addition, the curriculum also includes crucial modules on <strong>pedagogical skills in teaching about Open Science, such as basic didactic skills, activation tools for student-trainer interactions, leadership skills as well as modules on broader issues connected to teaching Open Science such as diversity, accessibility and cultural awareness.</strong> It will be delivered through interactive flipped-classroom formats and as self-paced hands-on online materials. Participants will receive certification upon completion, ensuring academic recognition of their new skills. In this, the program aims to build sustainable capacity within departments and to create a multiplier effect, fostering systemic shifts toward transparency and openness.</p>
<p><br><em>“We want to create a freely accessible program covering not only the know-how of open research Practices, but also to provide program participants with the pedagogical tools to confidently pass on their knowledge about Open Science to different audiences.”</em><br>— Dr. Sarah von Grebmer zu Wolfsthurn, LMU OSC Train-the-Trainer Program Coordinator</p>
<p><br><em>""At FORRT, we believe that equipping educators with both the tools and the values of Open Science is key to changing how research is taught and practiced.

<p>Findings show a high level of awareness of open research practices and strong favorable opinion about them, but a rather low level of adoption. To understand this implementation gap, we asked about downsides associated with the adoption of open research practices and about barriers such as lack of infrastructure, training, support, incentives, or policies. Downsides were infrequent and mitigatable, but barriers were numerous. A majority of respondents expressed a very high demand for training, especially guidance on reproducible workflow, and FAIR data and code sharing, and a need for support through expert consultations, and peer networks. Finally, there also was a misalignment between current assessment criteria (focusing on publication volume and the journal’s reputation) and indicators perceived as more meaningful by researchers, such as research quality, mentorship and teaching, and engagement with open research.</p>
<p>To overcome structural and cultural barriers to the adoption of open research practices, the OSC provides regular training (e.g. annual summer school), close consultation to research groups (e.g. Switch to Open Program), and is currently developing a Train-the-Trainer program.</p>
<p>We welcome BMC members and any other LMU members to collaborate with the OSC and take part in these programs to embed openness and reproducibility in their research practices.</p>

Some members of the LMU Open Science Center have contributed to the publication <a href=""https://elifesciences.org/articles/89736"">“Eleven strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions”</a>, which provides a detailed roadmap for implementing transparent and reproducible research at institutions. At LMU Munich, many of these strategies have already been put into practice.</p>
<p>The strategies are divided into three dimensions: First, “adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements” [strategies 1–3]; second, “training” [strategies 4–8], and third, “building communities” [strategies 9–11].</p>
<p>These dimensions address critical aspects of fostering a culture of open and reproducible research. Below, we outline the 11 strategies and provide examples for their implementation at LMU Munich.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1: Adapt curriculum to require reproducibility and open science training</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that students develop a strong foundation of open science knowledge it is important to adapt official curricula at universities. An example of this is the core curriculum for empirical practice course for undergraduate Psychology students at LMU Munich (<a href=""https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/studium/lehrelounge/kerncurriculum_empra/index.html"">https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/studium/lehrelounge/kerncurriculum_empra/index.html</a>). These cover essential open science topics such as FAIR data sharing or preregistration. By learning about open science from an early stage, students develop important habits for their future careers which is fundamental for making open research practices the norm.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2: Require reproducible research and open science practices in undergraduate and graduate theses</strong></p>
<p>At the LMU Department of Psychology, PhD students need to decide on a list of open science practices with their supervisors before they start their research. A completed disclosure form highlighting the implemented practices is part of their final PhD thesis submission. Read more and find templates at: <a href=""https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/osc/dissertation_agreement/index.html"">https://www.fak11.lmu.de/dep_psychologie/osc/dissertation_agreement/index.html</a></p>
<p>To incentivise change, it is important that institutions recognize and reward these practices:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3: Include reproducible and open science practices in research(er) assessment</strong></p>
<p>To acknowledge researchers following open science principles, the LMU Department of Psychology requires applicants for professor positions to provide statements on how they have implemented open science practices in their past work and plan to implement them in the future.</p>
<p>Such change in hiring procedures is supported by the LMU Open Science Center (OSC) for all the LMU Faculties who are institutional members of the OSC.</p>
<p>Fostering a culture of open science also requires providing researchers the tools and training they need to implement in their research.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 4: Offer reproducible research and open science courses</strong></p>
<p>As a grassroots initiative whose main activity is to provide peer-to-peer training, the LMU Open Science Center offers various workshops, lectures, and a yearly week-long summer school to impart transparent and reproducible research skills. Check out the material of past events and register for upcoming events at <a href=""https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/events/index.html"">https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/events/index.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 5: Integrate reproducibility and open science skills into courses on other topics</strong></p>
<p>Even if courses are not specifically about open science, but e.g. about research methodology, instructors can integrate elements of open research training like reproducible workflow tools, research data management, or skills to critically evaluate publication standards into their course. This way, rigorous and transparent practices are embedded in official curricula without requiring more teaching hours. Many of the 100+ OSC members have adopted this strategy, for instance <a href=""../../members/individual_members/fellows/mandl1/index.html"" title=""Mandl"">Maximilian Mandl</a> in his course “Grundlagen der Reproduzierbarkeit und Replizierbarkeit in der Statistik” for statisticians.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 6: Provide hands-on training</strong></p>
<p>Practical hands-on experience is essential for adopting reproducible research practices effectively. For this, members of the LMU Open Science Center have developed several self-paced tutorials on computing skills which can be found in our GitHub organization <a href=""https://github.com/lmu-osc"">https://github.com/lmu-osc</a>. Anyone is welcome to use them for self-learning or for teaching. These tutorials provide step-by-step guidance to implement new skills directly into a researcher's workflow.</p>
<p>Additionally the OSC collaborates with the Carpentries to teach researchers how to become instructors of essential coding, data analysis, and reproducible research skills. With our newly trained instructors, we offer many hands-on workshops by demonstrating ‘live’ how to programme, while students follow along.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, our workshop or summer school’s attendees return to their lab and struggle to implement their newly learned skills because of a disconnect with the practices of the rest of their team.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps, providing training to the entire research group could have the most transformative impact:</em></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 7: Conduct educational interventions for research groups</strong></p>
<p>A synchronous and collective switch from closed to open research practices by all members of a research group could ease the adoption of open research practices. The LMU Open Science Center just started to provide close and tailored consultations to individual research groups, providing resources to the team members such as our self-paced tutorials on essential computing skills, but also discipline specific self-learning resources to bridge their knowledge and skills gap together. The consultant and the team members are then writing together a standard open research practice guide that can be used as an onboarding document for new group members. This programme is part of the project ‘From local to systemic implementation: Embedding open research in institutional practices’ funded by the Volkswagen Foundation for 2025-2027 (<a href=""https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/news/vw_report/index.html"">read more</a>).</p>
<p><em>To foster critical thinking, metascientific projects and study replications can be integrated into course projects.</em></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 8: Perform replication or meta-research studies as course projects</strong></p>
<p>A member of the LMU Open Science Center, <a href=""../../members/individual_members/associated-members/seibold1/index.html"" title=""Seibold"">Dr. Heidi Seibold</a>, developed a course which aimed to reproduce longitudinal data analyses from various research articles, highlighting the challenges of computational reproducibility when source code is unavailable (<a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251194"">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251194</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to internal efforts, we are also inspired by the work of a previous guest speaker, <a href=""https://mgto.org"">Prof. Gilad Feldman</a>, who supports the use of the Registered Report format when supervising student replication projects. His work sets a high standard for integrating reproducible practices into coursework (the slides from his workshop can be found here: <a href=""https://osf.io/6vhsw/"">https://osf.io/6vhsw/</a>.</p>
<p><em>Besides imparting students and researchers with knowledge and skills for conducting open research, building communities around these practices further facilitates their adoption.</em></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 9: Organize journal clubs and other community-learning opportunities</strong></p>
<p>One effective way to foster collaboration and networking in academic communities is to organize gatherings like journal clubs, Hacky Hours, or discipline-specific meetups. By establishing a collaborative environment, researchers can exchange ideas, pieces of expertise, and practical tips, as well as explore limitations.</p>
<p>A great venue for that is the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club where researchers and students critically discuss papers and reflect on various open science practices. Read about other meetups the LMU Open Science Center supports at <a href=""https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/meetups/index.html"">https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/meetups/index.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 10: Creating resource hubs</strong></p>
<p>Resource hubs act as a central point for collecting and distributing resources at research institutions. The LMU Open Science Center is a network of 100+ members who contribute training resources, organize debates, symposia, and conferences, and who lobby, within their respective committees, in favor of open science. Learn how LMU members can join our community of advocates here: <a href=""https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/join/index.html"">https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/join/index.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 11: Connect individuals and initiatives involved in reproducible research and open science practices</strong></p>
<p>The LMU Open Science Center coordinates different initiatives both within and beyond the university: Internally, the center coordinates activities across its sub-initiatives e.g. the Open Science Initiative in Medicine (OSIM). Externally, it serves as e.g. the local node of the <a href=""https://reproducibilitynetwork.de"">German Reproducibility Network</a>, connecting LMU with national and international efforts.</p>
<p><em>By implementing these strategies, LMU Munich is helping to make reproducible research and open science standard practices in academia. Each step we take, from revising curricula to fostering collaboration, strengthens a culture of transparency and rigour at our institution and beyond.</em></p>

Forty early-career researchers had the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to make their research more transparent, reproducible, and credible.</p>
<p>The program featured a range of public lectures which provided a fundamental understanding of open science by approaching it from various perspectives. Prof. Dr. Felix Schönbrodt opened the program with a provocative talk about the replicability crisis, which highlighted the need for open science practices. Dr. Tim Errington shared eye-opening insights from the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology pointing out the challenges of replicating key experiments in cancer research due to lack of access to data, code, and materials. Many of the studies which could be performed again, surprisingly often failed to achieve similar results. Shifting to an eagle eye’s perspective, Prof. Dr. Richard McElreath held an engaging lecture describing science as amateur software development, explaining how adopting professional software practices could improve the quality of scientific research. Focusing on a more philosophical view, Prof. Dr. Sabina Leonelli explored ethical aspects of open science emphasizing the current limitations of the movement in advancing inclusions and diversity in research.</p>
<p>The lectures provided participants with both theoretical insights and practical examples, setting the foundation for the hands-on workshops. These workshops allowed attendees to implement practices that increase the reproducibility of their daily workflow such as programming in R or Python, literate programming (or reproducible manuscript writing) and version control. Participants also learned the practical aspects of FAIR data sharing and preregistration.</p>
<p><img height=""500"" width=""400"" src=""roompic.JPG"" alt=""roompic""></p>
<p>Alongside the educational content, the event fostered a collaborative atmosphere, allowing participants to benefit from meaningful exchanges with other researchers. The Hybrid Get to Know session provided the opportunity for in-person and online attendees to network with each other. Thematic exchanges encouraged participants to share their thoughts and to reflect on the material covered in lectures and workshops enabling participants to deepen their understanding and explore the limitations of open science practices. To close the week, the “What’s next?”- session prompted participants to reflect and plan or their future implementations of open research practices intheir research, anticipating possible social and technical challenges and ways to alleviate them successfully.</p>
<p><img height=""400"" width=""600"" src=""researcher.JPG"" alt=""researcher""></p>
<p>Looking back, the summer school was a great success: researchers were eager to engage and learn skills that increase the transparency and credibility of research, the feedback were overwhelmingly positive, and several wrote personally to express the deep impact it had on their approach to science and about their newfound passion for open science advocacy.</p>

This is a great recognition of our work and dedication to promoting open science.</p>
<p>The Open Access Enter-Award, supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the iRights Lab, recognizes outstanding commitment and dedication to open access.</p>
<p>At yesterday’s award ceremony, our student assistant, Gracia Prüm, had the privilege of representing the Open Science Center in Berlin. She introduced our grassroot initiative to the audience and also talked about our two upcoming programs “Switch-to-Open” and “Train-the-Trainer” which aim to foster a cultural shift at our institution towards open and reproducible science. Another important aspect which has been highlighted is a structural change of incentives for good research practices e.g by reforming the criteria of research assessment.</p>
<p>The event provided an excellent opportunity to connect with other inspiring projects which promote open access in our research culture. In a very warm and collaborative environment it was possible to engage in various discussions and to exchange ideas about ways of advancing open access and open science in academia.</p>
<p>Winning this award is a great honor for us and acknowledges our efforts and contributions in this field. It is gratifying to receive such an appreciation and validation of our work.</p>
<p>We want to thank the iRights Lab and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research for supporting such an important topic and organising this great event. It's a great sign to recognise and appreciate the engagement and contribution of different people in this field. We’re excited to build on this success and look forward to all upcoming projects with you.</p>

<p>Are you interested in <strong>becoming a certified instructor to teach your computing, software, and data skills that facilitate open and reproducible research?</strong></p>
<p>Through generous funding from the Munich Center for Machine Learning (<a href=""https://mcml.ai"" target=""_blank"">MCML</a>), the LMU Open Science Center (<a href=""https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html"" target=""_blank"">OSC</a>) and MCML have established an institutional membership between LMU Munich and <a href=""https://carpentries.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Carpentries</a>. The Carpentries is a non-profit, community-led organisation, which specialises in teaching basic <a href=""https://software-carpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Software</a>, <a href=""https://datacarpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Data</a>, or <a href=""https://librarycarpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Library</a> skills to researchers of all career stages and across disciplines, in an inclusive environment. By training trainers to teach reproducible tools that increase integrity, credibility, and reuse, this partnership will foster the expansion of the open science community in Munich.</p>
<p>As part of the institutional membership, <strong>we are able to offer training, free of charge, for 15 members (students or staff) of the LMU and TUM Universities to qualify as <a href=""https://carpentries.org/teach/"" target=""_blank"">instructors for The Carpentries</a></strong>. Five of these seats are reserved in priority for MCML members. The training involves attendance of a 16-hour online <a href=""https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/"" target=""_blank"">event</a>, followed by a simple check-out process. Applicants are expected to already know or be willing to learn on their own at least one of the practical skills they would teach in their future workshops (e.g. R and/or Python and/or Unix Shell and/or Git, and/or Open Refine and/or SQL, etc.), as the instructor training will focus on the didactics around teaching said skill(s). Certified instructors will then be able to help deliver <a href=""https://software-carpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Software</a>, <a href=""https://datacarpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Data</a>, or <a href=""https://librarycarpentry.org/"" target=""_blank"">Library</a> Carpentry workshops using the existing open source training material from the Carpentries, for example by co-teaching a workshop for their research group, department, or in a Faculty where computing skills training isn’t currently part of official curricula. <strong>We expect newly trained instructors to be involved in the delivery of at least one workshop in LMU or TU Munich within 12 months of completing the training.</strong></p>

<h2>Eligibility criteria</h2>
<p><br>This call is aimed at postgraduate research students, research staff or fellows, and research support staff from any department, who expect to be based in Munich at least through the end of June 2025.</p>
<h2>Selection criteria</h2>
<p><br>Places will be allocated in line with the goal of building a sustainable community of instructors based in Munich. Criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>career stage, motivation, and experience (i.e., balance between early-career researchers interested in building a community of peers, and permanent university staff already involved in training);</li>
<li>representation across Faculties (i.e., balance between disciplines with high demand for training in computing skills, and disciplines with limited training opportunities in this area);</li>
<li>previous involvement with the LMU Open Science Center and/or with The Carpentries (both favoured, but not necessary);</li>
<li>a commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, to ensure that all future workshop participants are able to access training in a welcoming environment.</li>

The Network’s goals are to promote open research practices through training and community building, to conduct meta-research, and to work with stakeholders across the sector to ensure coordination of efforts at the national level. The GRN was established in 2021 and includes institutional members and a network of grassroots initiatives.</p>
<p>Sharing the same goals, at the local level, the LMU Open Science Center has, since 2017, already made substantial contributions to promote open research practices (ORPs) across disciplines, at LMU Munich and beyond. The OSC onboards institutional (e.g. university departments) and individual members who commit to actively support the goals of the OSC. The Center organises workshops, seminars, conferences, panel discussions, and courses at the LMU; curates public online resources; coordinates local grassroots initiatives (e.g. Open Science Initiative in Psychology, in Medicine, in Statistics, and Reproducibility Journal Club); and serves as a forum that creates opportunities for collaboration on local meta-research projects.</p>
<p>The LMU OSC Academic Coordinator, Dr Malika Ihle, is ready to step up in the role of German Reproducibility Network Institutional Lead: “As the former Local Network Lead of the UK Reproducibility Network at the University of Oxford, I have seen what great progress such national collaboration can achieve. I’m excited to contribute to the development of a German strategic plan to improve research practices”.</p>
<p>The LMU OSC Speaker, Professor Ralf Ludwig, sees the membership with the GRN as a milestone: “Standards of good research practices are evolving, and the LMU OSC is committed to leading the way in this shift toward openness. We are excited to be part of the GRN and are looking forward to connecting with other stakeholders across the academic ecosystem so we can join our efforts and move together in the same direction.”</p>

As a center for applied cell science it bridges the gap between basic research and clinical application. The BMC researchers explore cell fates and cell plasticity from basic mechanisms to pathology and repair.</p>
<p>""The basic research conducted at the BMC is largely exploratory and thus not very standardized and particularly exposed to the problem of lack of reproducibility"", says Dr. Tobias Straub, head of the Core Facility Bioinformatics at the BMC. To address this, the BMC has set itself the goal of implementing Open Science standards and practices across the institute. The focus is on the core topics 'Experimental Design', 'Documentation' and 'Data Management' in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable). Pioneering work needs to be done in the development of guidelines and structures, as Tobias Straub points out, since there is very limited experience with corresponding practices in the field of exploratory basic biomedical research so far. Networking with the OSC is therefore particularly valuable for the BMC to exchange experiences, learn about best practices from different fields and get in touch with experts on open science topics.</p>

This is because Open Access to research results enables the rapid and worldwide dissemination of scientific findings.</p>
<p>However, this development poses financial challenges for research-intensive universities like LMU. It is therefore all the more gratifying that LMU, in collaboration with the University Library, was able to successfully place an application in the ""Open Access Publication Costs"" funding line of the German Research Foundation (DFG) to set up an ""LMU Open Access Fund"" endowed with 2.5 million euros for the years 2022 - 2024. In addition, LMU is providing 150,000 euros from its own funds for financing Open Access monographs.</p>
<p>All LMU scientists who are Corresponding Authors of a Gold Open Access article or an Open Access monograph can apply for a publication cost subsidy of up to 700 euros for articles or up to 5,000 euros for a monograph. This is intended to support the anchoring of Open Access, considering the diverse (disciplinary) publication cultures, and to go some way towards meeting financial challenges.</p>
<p>The application for the publication costs grant is made via an online platform developed by the University Library. The online application tool and further detailed information on the ""LMU Open Access Fund"" as well as the funding requirements can be found on the fund's website.</p>

<p>Potentially, research tracking of this kind can fundamentally contradict academic freedom and informational self-determination. It can endanger scientists and hinder the freedom of competition in the field of information provision. For this reason, scholars and academic institutions must become aware of the problem and clarify the legal, technical and ethical framework conditions of their information supply. This would not only help to avoid involuntarily violating applicable law, but also ensure that academics are appropriately informed and protected.</p>
<p>There is a petition by a group of scientists called <a href=""https://stoptrackingscience.eu"">""Stop tracking Science""</a> against this data tracking by privat companies that hundreds of researchers have already signed to stand up against this threat to academic freedom.

The cross-disciplinary consortium is dedicated to promote reproducible and robust research on a national level in Germany. The managing director of the LMU Open Science Center, Professor Felix Schönbrodt, says: ""Especially in times when medical and societal challenges require scientifically sound answers, we need an open, cooperative, and credible science. To achieve this goal, the German Reproducibility Network brings together key players in Germany.""</p>
<h3>Mission and goals</h3>
<p>Today, it seems more important than ever that research results are trustworthy and based on robust research. This includes transparency and openness to enable the reproducibility of research results as a key quality indicator in research, which is also in line with established principles of good scientific practice. With this background, the GRN was founded in January 2021. This peer-led cross-disciplinary consortium in Germany aims to increase trustworthiness and transparency of scientific research. Therefore, the network focuses on the following activities:</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: square;"">
<li>Support researchers in educating themselves about open science practices, and founding local open science communities.</li>
<li>Connecting local or topic-centered Reproducibility Initiatives to a national network, and foster connections between them.</li>
<li>Advise institutions on how to embed open science practices in their work.</li>
<li>Represent the open science community toward other stakeholders in the wider scientific landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p>The GRN is embedded in a growing network of similar initiatives as the <a href=""https://www.ukrn.org/"">UK Reproducibility Network</a>, <a href=""https://www.swissrn.org/"">Swiss Reproducibility Network</a>, <a href=""https://www.aus-rn.org/"">Australian Reproducibility Network</a> and <a href=""https://slovakrn.wixsite.com/skrn"">Slovak Reproducibility Network</a>.</p>

<h2>About the LMU Open Science Center</h2>
<p>The LMU's Open Science Center strengthens the commitment to open, transparent and replicable research. Its interdisciplinarity and breadth of expertise make it the first university center of its kind. If you vote for the OSC you would support its goals and help to keep the members working on the wide range of the following projects which might have gained even more importance during the covid-19-crisis:</p>
<p>The OSC was founded at the LMU in 2018 and has since then been working on three main areas: On the one hand, it wants to train young scientists as well as established researchers. Therefore, it organises workshops, conferences, talks and other events on Open Science and sensitize students to the topic. Secondly, it wants to explore the scientific process itself. In doing so, the scientific members are specifically investigating psychological, sociological and statistical-methodological aspects that can lead to distorted or incorrect research results. And finally, the OSC wants to make the incentive structures in the academic system a topic of discussion and to develop recommendations and proposals for relevant bodies. The OSC is particularly interdisciplinary in its approach; its members come from fifteen different disciplines - ranging from sociology to computer science and medicine.</p>
<p>Since science is under particular competitive pressure today, it is all the more important to ensure its quality and credibility and to promote transparency - also institutionally. The Open Science Center (OSC) of the LMU Munich pursues this approach and starts right away with the students. ""Especially in times when medical and social challenges require particularly scientifically sound answers, we need open, cooperative and credible science. The award of the Stifterverband is a wonderful confirmation of our approach to promote the reproducibility and traceability of scientific results,"" said Dr. Felix Schönbrodt, managing director of the OSC, after winning the monthly award.</p>
<p>The jury of the Stifterverband (Donors' Association for the Promotion of Sciences and Humanities in Germany) stated in its justification for the monthly award as a university pearl: ""With its comprehensive approach to Open Science, which ranges from training to incentive structures, the Open Science Center at LMU Munich opens up a large target group of students and researchers. The project promotes Open Science at all levels and also addresses current debates on Open Science and Open Data"". The Stifterverband awards the ""University Pearl"" prize to innovative projects at universities.</p>

<p>Scientific integrity is a core principle every researcher has to live up to every day. The LMU-ifo Economics &amp; Business Data Center (EBDC), the joint research data center of the ifo Institute and the LMU Munich, supports students and researchers from Munich and beyond with this task. We, the EBDC team, offer guidance and courses on good scientific practices and research data management. In addition, researchers have the opportunity to archive their research data at EBDC and make it available for replication and secondary research projects in several ways. Furthermore in our accredited research data center, local and visiting researchers have the possibility to work in a secure, well-equipped and supervised environment with sensitive, access-restricted data sets either from external data holders or the ifo firm data. The cooperation with the Research Data Center of the Federal Statistical Office also makes it possible to access research data sets from German official statistics.</p>

<h3>Practicing New Standards in Transparency and Reproducibility</h3>
<p class=""hinterlegt"">About a decade ago, John Ioannidis claimed that “most published research findings are false”. While seeming outrageous at the time, a growing body of meta-scientific research in the behavioral and social sciences has since substantiated this claim, causing uncertainty about the trustworthiness of published scientific findings. We believe that threats to the validity of published findings in the social sciences are widespread and systemic. Therefore, this conference promotes introspection about the current state of social science research and exchange on the opportunities for institutional and methodological improvement in the future. It is interdisciplinary in nature. Scholars working in any branch and within any methodology of the social sciences are invited to attend. The conference is supported by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) and will take place from 25-27 January 2019 at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) in Mannheim, Germany.</p>

Its aim is to make scientific research more transparent and to strengthen its self-correcting mechanisms by facilitating the replication of published work. Here's a portrait of the OSC.","27.07.2018",NA,"<p><em>[This is an updated English version of the LMU's original <a href=""https://www.uni-muenchen.de/aktuelles/news/2018/open_science_center.html"">press release</a>]</em></p>
<p>The OSC’s mission statement underlines the fact that good scientific practice sets high standards for researchers. Among others, published research needs to be transparent and reproducible. This means that all research processes must be reported in sufficient methodological detail to allow other appropriately trained scientists to repeat them and verify their conclusions. This requires the application of open science standards, such as the preregistration of study designs and the provision of open access to the study data and material. The OSC’s primary goal is to foster these standards by strengthening interdisciplinary expertise andmaking young researchers aware of the need for transparency and reproducibility. Achieving these goals will in turn require detailed studies of research practices and replication processes in various disciplines, continuing education of qualified researchers in these areas and convincing grant agencies and other relevant institutions of the need to promote openness in science.</p>
<p>The creation of the Open Science Center is a central part of LMU‘s commitment to fostering best practices in scientific research. “For a university of excellence, the establishment of such a center is a highly pertinent and very welcome step,” says Professor Barbara Conradt, Vice-President for Research and Diversity. The OSC’s Spokesperson, LMU sociologist Professor Katrin Auspurg, underlines the Center’s importance: “We need institutions that are committed to the ideals of open science, work to develop consistent standards, carry out research on replicability, increase the general awareness of the issue, and ensure that the organizations involved in the research enterprise take due cognizance of its significance. The relentless competition for resources, funding, and faculty positions should not tempt researchers to focus on areas that are guaranteed to make headlines or to publish as much, as quickly, and as prominently as possible. They must also focus on quality control, on reliability and reproducibility, and ensure that their procedures are transparent and accessible to others in their field. The OSC will take on a pioneering role in this respect, by exploring ways to improve research practices and strengthen trust in the scientific enterprise as a whole.”</p>
<h3>Goals of the OSC</h3>
<p>The new Center has chosen to focus on three major goals. The first is to train researchers in Open Science skills and to increase the students’ and junior researchers’ awareness for good scientific practice. This will be done by providing workshops, informal conferences, and other training modules.</p>
<p><br>Secondly, the Center will make the scientific process the subject of research– in other words, conduct research on the research process. Here, the idea is to explore the psychological, sociological, statistical, and methodological aspects of scientific procedures, which can lead to erroneous or biased research results.</p>
<p>Finally, the OSC plans to act as a think tank and to instigate a reform of incentive structures that mold the modern-day practice of research and science: Scientific publication standards as well as criteria for the evaluation of researchers in faculty search and grant application procedures should incentivize good scientific practice. “It is vital to take a closer look at the quality and replicability of research,” says psychologist Dr. Felix Schönbrodt, the Center’s Managing Director, who was also closely involved in its conception and design. “The Open Science Center signals our commitment to a program. We committed to integrity and dependability, and we seek to impart these values in our teaching, in our recruitment policies, in our activities as reviewers, and – above all – in our day-to-day practice as researchers.” Among other things, this will enhance the University’s long-term competitiveness. “For example, in the context of research funding by the EU, and with the establishment of the new Open Research Funders Group, the issue of open science will in future play a central role in determining the approval of grants for proposed research projects.”</p>
<h3>An interdisciplinary focus</h3>
<p>The OSC is an unequivocally interdisciplinary enterprise. Its 35 members [as of July 2018] represent 11 different areas of study, ranging from sociology to informatics and geography. The Faculties of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, and Psychology and Education have all joined the new venture, as well as the LMU-ifo Economics &amp; Business Data Center. In addition, the OSC’s work will be supported by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ) and the University Library.</p>
<p>The idea has aroused great interest at LMU. “We have approached lots of people and the response has been unexpectedly enthusiastic,” says Schönbrodt, and he goes on to point out the great promise of open science for its practitioners. “Adherence to the tenets of Open Science improves the planning, execution and analysis of research studies and facilitates their publication and it helps to counteract biases before they become actionable”.</p>
<p>The Center will also provide a forum for the publication of negative results and replication studies. And although this type of work is said to be less spectacular than primary studies that report new findings, it is essential as a test of the robustness and validity of published claims. “Seen in this light, open science offers researchers a valuable tool in the quest for well-founded and trustworthy insights into the world around us.”</p>

        </div>","<p>In recent years, headlines have repeatedly reported that scientific results could not be reproduced, even under the same experimental conditions. The speaker of the newly founded LMU Open Science Center (LMU OSC), sociologist Prof. Dr. Katrin Auspurg, explains these alarming findings: “Competition for funding and professorships has led people to publish as many articles as possible in the shortest time possible in a marketing-effective way. This incentive structure often negatively affects the truthfulness of published research.”</p>
<p><strong>Transparency in research: The foundation for credible and successful science</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, science organizations have been demanding data and results generated in publicly funded research projects to be made openly available in order to enable reexamination and further analyses.</p>
<p>“In times where we see frequent debates over fake news, it is very important to strengthen the trust in science”, clarifies the center's managing director, psychologist Dr. Felix Schönbrodt, who played a major role in establishing the Center. “The Open Science Center is a strong signal: We stand for integrity and reliability and support these principles in our teaching, our personnel decisions, as reviewers, and especially in our daily practice as researchers.”</p>
<p>Thereby the competitiveness of the university is increased as many research funders, such as the ERC or the newly founded “Open Research Funders Group” emphasize the topic Open Science in their funding guidelines for new research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Putting Open Science into action at LMU Munich</strong></p>
<p>Prof. Dr. Barbara Conradt, the LMU’s vice president for research and diversity, pointed out, that “first and foremost, excellent research means producing correct and replicable results. In this respect, the foundation of the Open Science Center complements the LMU’s bigger strategy of supporting good scientific practice.”</p>
<p>the OSC seeks to accomplishing this goal by offering public talks, trainings programs and workshops for scientists at all stages of their career, from PhD students to professors. Furthermore, the Center plans to conduct “research about research”, by investigating the scientific process itself. Thereby, psychological, sociological, and statistical/methodical aspects are investigated which lead to biased or wrong results in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>The Center’s 17 founding members come from ten different scientific fields, ranging from sociology to geography. Three complete faculties of the LMU – the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, as well as the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences – have joined the Center’s mission. Additionally, the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) and the University Library are supporting the Open Science Center.</p>
<p>All members of the LMU Open Science Center share one common goal: Fostering good science and generating reliable knowledge through transparent and replicable research. For a society that can trust in it.</p>
