<!-- The "includes" below are templates for the different sections of the
member profile pages. Each document returns an R object that contains the
necessary HTML elements to render the section.
 1. You can modify these templates to change the layout or content of each section. This will change the layout of all member profiles the next time the site is built.
 2. You can also create new templates for additional sections if needed.
 3. If you want to add some custom content for an individual member, you can do so directly in the member's .QMD file, outside of the includes. You will then need to insert the new R object containing HTML into the `profile` object below.
